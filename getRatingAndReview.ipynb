      " When I first saw the advertisements for \"The Weather Man\", it seemed like the movie was going to be another formulaic, feel good Hollywood redemption tale. In reality, it is a dark, scathing satire of American values. The marketing likely scared away a lot of people who would enjoy the film, while attracting an audience who was presented with something unexpected and perhaps uncomfortable. The comedy is quite raunchy, the tone is bleak, and the story is anything but formulaic, throwing industry conventions right out the window, which leads to a film that's more believable than most.David Spritz is a man whose life has become the ultimate exercise in futility. Each day, he wakes up and goes to a job that, despite paying a handsome salary, is entirely unfulfilling. His relationship with his ex-wife is strained, his relationship with his children distant. To make things worse, his Pulitzer Prize winning father seems to be disappointed in what David has done with his life.In real life, progress in one's personal life is generally made in baby steps. Usually, people don't undergo a drastic transformation over the course of several months. David attempts to improve his standing in life, at times failing entirely, at times succeeding in small doses. The results of these attempts range from very funny to downright saddening, and this helps lend the film an air of realism. This is a complicated character study about a man coming to grips with the fact that he's failed to meet any of the goals he set for himself in life, despite attaining a social standing that many people are envious of. There aren't any easy answers or life altering epiphanies; self-improvement is a long, gradual task that will probably never be completely fulfilled, and \"The Weather Man\" reflects this reality. While not for all tastes, this movie deserves credit for tackling a relatively conventional subject in a very unconventional, at least for a mainstream Hollywood movie, manner. I imagine that this film will be a bigger success overseas and on DVD than it will be in its US theatrical run. \n",

      " I've thought long and hard before saying what I'm about to say. I've searched my memory for something to disprove it, but I can't think of anything. Here it is: The Weather Man, the new film directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Steve Conrad, is the most relentlessly pessimistic mainstream American film that I have ever seen. It seems to be telling us that over time you become a shell of the person you once were and a pathetic, ever decreasing fraction of the person you one day hoped to be. You will squander potential and become incapable of giving meaningful love to anyone that you care about. This doesn't happen as a result of some huge disaster or tragic mistake, no, this happens as a result of hundreds of minuscule failures every day. As you might imagine, this is excruciating to watch. But in creating one of bleakest portraits of contemporary American life you will ever see, Gore Verbinski also creates a film that is shockingly humane, funny, and beautiful.Nicolas Cage, who I don't always like, gives a fantastic performance as David Spritz, a Chicago TV weather man with no degree in meteorology. The thing that makes him great in The Weather Man is that he consistently plays the part in earnest. There's plenty of opportunities to ham it up or play it for laughs, especially because David acts like such an asshole so much of the time, but Cage never falls into those traps. One feels at every turn, no matter how disgraceful his behavior, that he's just a guy trying to do what seems right to him in that moment. At one point he drops his daughter off at his ex-wife's house. When his ex-wife, played with terrific subtly by Hope Davis, remains outside for a moment he suddenly decides to throw a snowball at her, which hits her in the face and cracks the lens of her glasses. Rather than playing it like it's funny, which it is, Cage seems like he's making a sincere attempt to connect with his former wife in any way he can.I wish with great passion that this film was truly great, but unfortunately it's just inches short. Nine out of ten times Verbinski hits the mark. From the very first shot he creates a perfectly executed world of an ice bound Chicago during the winter months. His most impressive feat though is managing to craft a film that is in some ways highly stylized, yet instinctually feels like the human experience. He has a wonderful and surprising sense of composition. One finds the characters in disconcertingly angular frames with vast expanses of empty space above their heads. In tandem with this he uses a fantastically chilly color scheme throughout. He also triumphs in his insistently measured pacing. In contrast with such a harsh statement about life, the pacing serves to lend the film a strange gentleness that allows for us to feel the characters are truly human. The pacing is absolutely vital and absolutely brave in a Hollywood film. Along with the performances, it makes one feel that the characters are being not being tortured out of gleeful spite on the part of the filmmakers, but out of profound empathy and understanding of our shared human weaknesses.Verbinski's trouble comes in just a few isolated areas; nevertheless they are important and significantly damage the film as a whole. The ugliest problem is a woefully ill-advised quasi dream sequence in which Nicholas Cage sees himself happy and well adjusted as the grand marshal of a parade. The whole thing is presented as if his hotel room window is like a TV on which he is seeing himself. It introduces us to no useful ideas and is an immensely distracting stylistic departure. I'm really puzzled by its inclusion in a movie that on the whole demonstrates a lot of restraint. Another issue is the handling of Cage's son, who gets himself involved in a weird molestation situation with his drug counselor. This subplot is painted in the broadest of strokes, rather than with the painstaking specificity one finds elsewhere. Every time we return to the plot with the son the film begins to feel bogged down and uncharacteristically unsure of itself. Some of the blame for this surely must be shared with Steve Conrad, the mostly solid writer of the film. One wonders why Conrad and Verbinski shy away from the unbending frankness they are generally so willing to dole out. There are a few other troubling mistakes, the blame for which I have to rest on both of their shoulders. Most notably the film relies too heavily on voice-over. While some of it works very well and all of it is delivered with sincerity from Cage, there is at least twice as much as is necessary. Similarly, there are a couple flashbacks that work, but just as many that are unneeded. Also, the handling of Cage's father, who is played with solemn dignity by Michael Cane, rings a little false. He is written as a noble and stalwart man devoid of any flaws not only in Cage's mind, but apparently in real life as well. On the whole this actually works much better than it should, but I can't help but feel that there's a note missing.The aforementioned issues aside, The Weather Man is a rare achievement and one of my favorite films of the year. It is so honest and so bleak that I can't believe that a major studio let it get made. In an industry where schlock and melodrama are passed off as great statements about us as humans The Weather Man is monumentally refreshing. I have nothing but respect for Verbinski and Conrad for having the nerve to make a film that on the one hand is crushingly negative, but on the other endlessly humane. \n",

      " Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean X3, The Ring, The Mexican) has an uncanny way of moving strange characters through bizarre plots while maintaining our interest and our empathy. THE WEATHER MAN was so poorly promoted when it hit the theaters that it seemed like it was going to be one of those asinine food throwing slapstick comedies instead of the very serious examination of contemporary life in the big cities, or even more about the struggle of a disillusioned man who cannot find a balance between business success and family/marital failure, it is. This viewer almost ignored it completely - until the DVD.David Spritz (Nicholas Cage) is a TV pawn the station uses as a weatherman: he is untrained as a meteorologist, skilled only be his TV persona success dependent on a created gag/tag line - the Nipper (the peak worst day in the forecast). His personal life is a mess, separated from a disconsolate wife Noreen (Hope Davis), distanced from his successful writer father Robert (Michael Caine) and on shaky territory with his two children - fat and sad Sully (Gemmenne de la Peña) and sweet but troubled pothead Mike (Nicholas Hoult). To make life worse his TV persona follows him into the streets of blustery Chicago where his viewers either seek autographs invading his privacy or throw food at him as the progenitor of the lousy cold weather. This polarized existence is invaded by an offer to become weatherman on Bryan Gumbel's Hello America show in New York (a career jump for which he longs for many reasons), serial confrontations with his father whom he emulates but always feels a failure, the finding that his father has lymphoma, the ridicule of fat Shelly at school, Mike's edgy involvement with his drug counselor Don (Gil Bellows), and Noreen's new live-in Russ (Michael Rispoli). How David meanders through this quagmire of dilemmas is the story and while it is not pretty, it is pungent.Cage inhabits the strange role of David finding a way to make this loser with a short temper someone about whom we care. It is a tough assignment but Cage meets it on every level. Michael Caine provides some of the more eloquent moments in the film: his words of wisdom and view of life are the only grounded elements of the story. Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la Peña and Hoult. The subject of the film is tough and the excessive use of potty mouth language is overbearing and at times one wishes Verbinski would have edited some of the gross food slinging scenes.But as an overall message movie there is much here to admire. It simply is not the mindless slapstick the posters and trailers would indicate. The PR folks on this one blew it. Worth your time and attention. Grady Harp \n",

      " This movie was a great piece of social commentary on the emptiness of our current American culture. Being the weatherman appears to be a great job. It pays almost $300 Grand a year, and you can afford a nice apartment and a mansion for your beautiful blonde ex-wife and your two estranged children. A job as a weatherman, without a meteorological degree entails absolutely no challenges. You become lazy and bored, because you think you have everything. After all, isn't the entire purpose of life to make money, drive nice cars, and wear nice clothes, and eat out every night of the week? You are able to spoil your children, hence never teaching them the value of challenging themselves and depriving them of ever working toward a goal and feeling satisfied. This is what we think living is today in this country! We have no depth! We have toxic vocabulary, eat useless toxic food, we watch useless toxic entertainment, and we have completely useless jobs that create nothing. We wonder why our children have no idea what to do with themselves? Wealthy Americans, which most of us are by the standards of the world, have no skills, no integrity, and no character. The only things our children grow up knowing for sure, are what a Frosty is, and a Big Gulp. The gap between this generation and their grandparents is vast. Our elders worked hard at jobs which created the foundation of wealth and substance that we erode every day with our irresponsible selfish consumerist conduct. Mr. Spritz has no idea what a Big Gulp is, but he's dying of the cancer that eats this country.The Weatherman (Nicholas Cage) has a better time with himself, and everyone else as soon as he figures this out. Hilariously, he had to actually get hit in the head with a Big Gulp. We need to focus on the things that matter, take responsibility for our children, and ourselves. The one thing that I think was off in the movie was the line about how being an adult does not include the word easy. The big secret to life, is that when we do things the correct way, often the hard way, life actually gets easier, for everyone.I went to the theater expecting the usual vacuous Hollywood bomb. I was blown away with the power of this movie. On the way out, we asked a young man that was working the theater what he thought. He said that he thought The Weatherman was incredibly dark and very far fetched. I agree, our culture is dark and far fetched. The movie, however, was dead on. Our current life is a bubble about to burst. This movie offered a solution - find some meaning in your life and get after it. Pretending this vacuum doesn't exist, and that Jessica and Ashley Simpson are talented individuals worth our time and interest, is incredibly bleak to me. On the other hand, I was pretty sure this young man had no idea the scale of these problems. How could he, when he has never experienced anything else. \n",

      " Thankfully Hollywood has made a movie that values our integrity and intelligence. Here is a film showing us that life is beautiful but challenging and requires a little bit of work to move through. Through its protagonist, we encounter daily frustrations of every type, from conjugal discord to simple dissatisfaction's with our everyday existence. Nicholas Cage might not have the extended range of performers like Penn or Brando, but he does competent work here. He earns our sympathy and our attention with some of the best work he has done recently.\"The Weather Man\" is an extended metaphor for what goes on in our lives every day. The film apparently didn't charm the pants off a few members of the audience when I saw it. It didn't have the prepackaged bombs and special effects. It lacked enough vulgarity to appeal to those people;instead it had one of the most touching and intelligent scripts in the last year. Attendance might be down, and ironically quality is up in Hollywood. \"The Weather Man\" deals with real issues such as insecurity, love, and trust. It presents scenarios where the audience might become uncomfortable looking at an aspect of their lives they might not like. Here is a parent who is challenged by his inability to connect with his own children, who appears to have unsurmountable challenges dealing with a spouse, and who is now not very sure his job is truly what he always wanted.Michael Caine once again shines in his supporting role as the father who can't communicate with his son, and has now pressing issues to deal with before it's too late. Hope Davis does a bit of against-type work with a woman who might be lacking in the warmth department. Both are impeccable and very effective in their performances.Verbinsky keeps a leisured pace, allowing the audience to meditate and understand how critical this stage of his life is for Dave (Cage). This is a sink or swim situation, and he must do some careful reevaluation in order to succeed. Whether he is able or not, is one of the joys of the film. This movie will be remembered for its depth and quality, for its attention to detail, as well as its realistic approach. It's a 10! \n",

      " I can already tell that people are going to have very strong reactions to The Weather Man. People are either going to love it or hate it. They're going to find it shockingly hilarious or just plain shocking. I loved it and found it hilarious, but I'm not easily offended (I do a show with Jegar, how can anything offend me?). There were many instances where I was the only person laughing in the theater. For instance, Michael Caine, who plays Robert Spritz, tells his son David Spritz (played by Nicolas Cage) that David's daughter is getting teased at school and called \"Camel Toe\". Just to hear Sir Michael Caine use the expression \"camel toe\" is pretty unexpected. But then various shots of camel toes pop up on the screen to illustrate this phenomenon to anyone in the audience who's unfamiliar with the concept. I found it all absurdly hilarious, but I don't think many of the grey-haired audience shared my sentiments.This movie was not at all like I was expecting. The Weather Man is crass and silly, but it's also extremely dark and sad. David Spritz is a sad, lonely man who's trying to reconcile with this ex-wife and get his family back together, but despite his best intentions, things just never work out the way he wants. More than anything, he wants to prove to his dying father that he can be a great man too, but time is running out. This is not your typical comedy. It's not easy to watch sometimes, but according to Robert Spritz, \"Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.\" \n",

      " I saw a screening of this tonight, and I was very impressed. I expected a rather shallow comedy, but instead, received a well-thought out and delivered work which was insightful, quirky, funny and touching film which was far above my expectations. Cage delivers a great performance as usual, and the father-son relationship between Cage and Caine was authentic and balanced. This is not just a comedy, but is a study of the importance of family, and an overlying existential questioning of what our lives are all about. I highly recommend it for men and women alike. On a side note... Verbinski's works are diverse, fun, and interesting, and this is no exception. \n",

      " The Weather Man is a low key movie about a boring person who is deluded about life in a clueless manner. He had a great award winning dad, he became a fairly inept dad, and he's trying to change that.The film is pretty monotone in term of story and visual to underline exactly how bland the guy and his job are. Nicolas Cage doesn't have a great acting range, but this role fits him pretty well, and he did a great job. Michael Cain plays a good counter point, and makes Cage's character more bearable.The piece is funny, in a chuckle kind of way, with lots of sad undertone. It's quietly entertaining, but won't really make you notice.If you want to see something different, you might want to try this. \n",

      " Summary: A middle aged weather man with a failing family life, sick parent and dull job copes with his life and aspires to move to a national TV show.A great movie about the modern dilemma. It is about American society and its problems seen through the life of one guy. It talks about his problems, his mortality, his moral failings, and his caring soul as well. Nicely written, great photography of Lake Michigan covered in ice. Lots of great scenes where Nicholas Cage pull off difficult performances. Many sadly comic scenes including a dream sequence with Sponge Bob that is a wonderfully surreal. I am afraid that disapproving critics don't understand the deep irony and existential humor like a Kurt Vonnegut novel. Nothing illustrates this better than the scene where Cage's character sees the giant balloon of Sponge Bob floating by. The meaning and meaningless of life together with family and ambition together with human frailty come together wonderfully and with humor. \n",

      " Yeah yeah, I get it, film snobs. This is high art. It's an homage to melancholic French film noir, with lots of drab snow and blue filtered lenses. \"You just don't understand tragic comedy,\" some of you may suggest. Oh, I understand it all right. Only \"The Weather Man\" makes a dog's dinner of that particular genre, if that's indeed what they were going for. I'm not sure.If awards are given for such things, Nick Cage might get an award for maintaining the same long monotonous hang-dog facial expression in nearly every scene for two hours of screen time. Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton perfected this bit. The sad, luckless clown, wondering through life getting beat down, but winning our hearts because they persevere. Cage can't bring it on like Keaton. About half way through this mess, I was hoping he'd get hit with a brick, not a sandwich.But I have to hand it to Paramount Pictures for the most shameless product placement I've ever seen in a film: They literally throw their products, logos and all, right at Cage, making the image stick in your mind while it sticks to Cage's suits and overcoats.Splat! McDonalds. Splat! Big Gulp, 7-Eleven. Splat! Splat! Taco Bell. And it case you were too dense to pick up on that, you could see the McDonalds golden arches reflected in window glass and slightly out of focus in the background of a half dozen shots. I mean, come on! If this was supposed to be Haute Ciné, it must be some kind of cynical inside joke to have the lead character covered in advertising like a NASCAR hot rod.I won't spoil it for those of you who like to wallow in excruciating maudlin muck. I know some people are uplifted watching other people morbidly depressed. But for the rest of us who may be less enlightened to the entertainment or artistic value of watching some unloved schmendrick stumbling along in misery, this film will make you want to have a drink, or several. Or worse, jump off a tall building or stick your head in a gas oven.In short, this film doesn't deliver any truth you didn't have already. It's just a depressing mess.It was only when Michael Cane's character delivered the line: \"In this sh*t life, you have to chuck some things\" pretty far into the picture when I suddenly realized I should have chucked this thing after the first twenty minutes. Take his advice, and mine, and leave this one on the video rental shelf. \n",

      " Greetings again from the darkness. So Close. This is painfully close to being a great film. Although still very good at presenting issues normally not seen on film, director Gore Verbinski (\"Pirates of the Caribbean\" \"The Ring\") falls just short of making a very powerful statement.Please do not let the trailer fool you. This is not slapstick comedy like \"Anchorman\". This is deep, often dark subject matter addressing the emotional struggles men face when dealing with a bad divorce, trying to maintain a relationship with kids, and the pressures of trying to make one's own dad proud (or at least gain acceptance). So often Hollywood deals with the plight of the woman and her emotional turmoil. Instead we are \"treated\" with watching a man's attempt to live up to (what he thinks are) expectations of others and how somehow the right job will make everything OK ... his life will be whole.Nicolas Cage gives another outstanding performance as \"The Weather Man\" on a Chicago TV station. To add to the complexity, he is not a meteorologist and he is being courted by a national morning talk show featuring Bryant Gumbel. Two areas with this character are poorly written in my opinion. First, Cage's hair weave is bloody awful. At least in Dallas, weather men all look like Televangelists with perfect hair. His is always askew ... don't they have hair/make-up staff in Chicago? Second, the character is written as too much of a loser in all aspects. He is not just struggling, he is not someone any guy or girl would want to hang with. The film tries, but fails, to show the \"switch\" come on when Cage steps in front of the camera. They tell us this happens, but it needed to be presented much clearer.Playing Cage's father, Michael Caine is a pretty intimidating figure as he is confused about his son's direction in life while at the same time facing a very dark future of his own. Caine is wonderful in the role and when he tells his son \"Sometimes in life, you just have to chuck it\", we really get it and hope that Cage does as well.On the other hand, Hope Davis is cast as yet another frigid \"B\" yuppie whom I don't understand how any man could be attracted to. Yet somehow this is the woman Cage wants back. Time to stretch your talent a bit Hope. You showed plenty of promise in \"About Schmidt\" and have been working steadily since. But to take the next step as an actress, you need to try a new character. Gil Bellows (\"Aly McBeal\") has a creepy role as Cage's teenage son's counselor. He is responsible for some of the most uncomfortable moments as well as a way for Cage to finally cut loose.As I said, this is a very good movie that falls just short of greatness. While providing insight into the male psyche, it fails to deliver the message or solution it seemed to be leading up to. However, it is nice to see a man portrayed as something other than a superhero, adulterer, international spy or Olympic caliber lover. \n",

      " Nicholas cage plays the same character time after time. He is alone; he once had a nice family; his children are weird or dysfunctional. He has done something in the past that has left him out there on an island of hopelessness and depression. He also manages to get back to the surface and begin to live. He has acuity and knows that he has screwed up. He is ready for redemption but has to find the way there. In this one he is a very talented guy who has on-screen charisma but has been relegated to doing the weather on television. He must be quite popular because people recognize him enough to pelt him with garbage. We know that at some point the universe will right itself and allow him to have his day. The relationship with his sad daughter is what this film is really about, and there is a bittersweet reclamation that takes place.

      " David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is an affable weather reporter on local Chicago television. He is well liked and may even be in the running for a bigger gig on a national morning show out of NYC. However, away from the cameras, things are very different. For one, David's father, Robert Spritzer (Michael Caine) is a famous writer who has cast enormous footprints for his son to follow. Now, news comes that his dad is seriously ill. In addition, David is divorced from his beautiful wife, Noreen (Hope Davis) and has trouble connecting with his children, teenage Michael (Nicholas Hoult) and twelve year old Shelley. Shelley, especially, is a point of concern, for she is slightly overweight and the object of school bullies, on occasion. Although David tries to ignite her interest in hobbies, such as archery, Shelley remains very aloof. It is, in fact, Robert, who has the better relationships with his granddaughter, grandson, and ex-daughter-in-law. Therefore, while Daivd continues to let a smile be his umbrella, on the news, he is juggling major problems with his family AND pursuing the chance to be a bigtime weatherman on a national show. Will he be able to maintain his sanity? This is a dark, dark film, in the vein of American Beauty, but, alas, not quite as good or cohesive as that Oscar-winning movie. However, Cage, as usual, does an excellent job as the very mixed-up local television star and, be still dear hearts, he looks very handsome. The rest of the cast is also superlative in their difficult roles, especially Caine as the highly intelligent and refined author. The scenery in and around Chicago is mostly bleak, as the film takes place in winter while the costuming and camera work are excellent. Thus, the film's deficiencies stem mostly from an uneven script and a very slow-moving pace. Yet, despite this, the movie has some sharp observations to make about the human condition. If you are in a depressed mood, DO NOT see this one, as it can lay low the most optimistic of folks. But, if you are a fan of Cage, Caine, or the other cast members or if you have a yen to ponder the dark side of life, this flick does offer much food for thought, indeed. \n",

      " At first, it would seem that The Weather Man doesn't have a point to make. We follow David Spritz as his life falls apart around him, and it would seem like that's all the film is. By the ending; we do get a defining point, and while Gore Verbinski hammers it home a little too hard for it to be as effective as it could have been; it's a good point and gives credence to a thoroughly enjoyable little film. This is a pretty big change of pace from the big budgeted kids' films that Verbinski has been making recently, and his approach to this far more low key film is sombre and relaxed, and The Weather Man benefits from that. The plot focuses on the difference between one man's personal and working life. At work, he is a successful weather man, who's been headhunted by a bigger network. But in his private life, he's estranged from his wife; his kids aren't exactly top of the class and just to top it all off, every time he steps onto the street, fast food gets thrown at him! Spiralling downwards, his life is approaching collapse; and he must choose between his family and a big salary in New York.Nicolas Cage takes the lead role, and while he's never really stretched; he manages to give a fine performance throughout the film. In support, we've got the likes of Michael Caine and Hope Davis, as well as talented youngster Gemmenne de la Peña, who all round the acting off nicely. The film manages to pull together two very different tones and make it work. There's some rather funny humour on display, and this is mixed with an overall pessimistic mindset. This gives The Weather Man something of an original standpoint, and although it has to be said that the plot itself is never overly interesting, the tone of the movie is good enough to see it through. From mainstream cinema; especially American mainstream cinema, you don't expect to see films with such a depressing viewpoint on life - but it really doesn't get much more depressing than the one professed here. Verbinski's film states that, like the weather, life cannot be predicted - and no matter what hopes and dreams you have, they're likely to be smashed by the time it comes to realising them. Ouch. \n",

      " There is really no reason to watch this movie.When I saw the preview, it looked like a quirky, off-the-beaten-path kind of film - just the type of film that I usually enjoy. However, it was nothing of the kind. Firstly, it's not even close to being funny - anyone expecting to laugh will be heartily disappointed. It's actually one of the more depressing movies I've seen lately. Yes, it's quirky, but in all the wrongs ways. The characters are uninteresting, the acting and dialogue are horrible, and the plot is simply uninteresting. This kind of film is actually becoming a cliché in Hollywood - successful white guy has mid-life crisis and questions his existence. The trouble is that I've already seen this same movie half a dozen times, and much better done. This movie also features a truly sickening amount of product placement. Only \"Castaway\", which was basically one long Fed Ex commercial, comes close in this department.To sum up, there's really no reason to see this movie, it's garbage. \n",

      " This is another one of those Hollywood movies that thinks that by showing a man (Cage) who is self-centered and pretty much a moron with a touch of darkness(ie:Sideways) the movie is reaching to the more intelligent audience. Not the case. This movie made me so frustrated because it was so bad. It had a feeling like the director and the writer were just being smug by putting together a story of someone so mundane and self-centered that they could pass this off as dark comedy. It is pitiful and very painful to watch. I do not want to put any spoilers in here so more people will read this and hopefully never go to this heap of garbage. Needless to say I even think less now than I did before of Cage and put him right there with the likes of Keanu Reeves. The Weather Man finds Nicolas Cage in a self-pitying mood. In the past, this would have been happy news. Cage in a funk was good for ''Leaving Las Vegas\" and ''Adaptation.\" Even in a movie as imbalanced as Martin Scorsese's ''Bringing Out the Dead,\" Cage's depression soulfully complemented Scorsese's mania. Those movies gave Cage an opportunity to be inventive and inspired. The Weather Man gives him license to drift for nearly two hours like a parade float. The film takes too many of its cues from Dave's (Cage) depression. It is like a funeral. I really have to laugh and get a little peeved when I see many people get suckered in and write \"good\" and \"Great!\" for their review here on IMDb. In the end this movie's attempt at self-centered humor flops unlike Sideways which was overrated yet still far better than The Weather Man. Forecast: Stay away from this dust-bowl of stink. \n",

Yes it is and you could also argue that it is a clever one (especially after having seen the trailer) ... but that is also one of the weaknesses of this movie ... it never really fulfills your expectations that you might have (if you have the same as I did), which is to see a cleverly knitted commentary on our society and family life! And it all begins very well, every scene does make sense in the overall context. But then suddenly after you've passed the middle of the movie, the movie comes to a full stop. At least it feels like that.

      " WARNING: LOTS OF SPOILERSThis movie got marketed as though it were a comedic piece of fluff. People came in expecting something to laugh at, and of course they were disappointed. If you in the mood for light hearted fare, you would not have been pleased at this film.I didn't have a TV when The Weather Man came out, and I hadn't seen the trailers, so I went in with no preconceived notions at all, What I came away with was the feeling that I had watched the best movie of the year.This is not a humorous movie in the least. It's the story of a man going through a mid-life crisis, and it never takes the easy way out. Nicolas Cage's \"David Spritz\" is the son of Pulitzer Prize winning author \"Robert Spritzen\", played by Michael Caine. Caine's character is dying, and Cage's character has never lived up to his father's image. He's tried writing a novel, but frankly, it stinks.Instead, Cage is a TV Weather Man. Every day he provides the people of Chicago with the two TV minute equivalent of a McDonald's Happy Meal. He's extremely good at what he does, but he also feels valueless. His personal life is the same: with his mini-celebrity he can get laid any time he wants, but he has completely botched it with the one love of his life.Every time I thought that this film would go for the cheap emotional reward, instead the film takes real life turns. Cage still loves his ex-wife, but he never gets her back, and instead she marries someone else. Michael Caine's character dies on the day that Cage is auditioning for his first national morning show shot, and instead of breaking down on the set, Cage nails his audition. (Nice cameo by Bryant Gumbel btw).And that is where the films ends. Cage's life remains disturbing. He's deleted his half-finished novel. He doesn't get his wife back. He moves away from his children. His father is dead, and Cage will never match what he was. But he comes to a certain peace. He understands that the time in his life for trying to be something is over. He is something. It's not the storybook ending, but for 99.9 percent of us this is how it goes. We want a lot of things for ourselves, we don't get all of them, and we learn to accept the things that we have. We grow up.The only movie I've seen that compares to this film is Mickey Rourke's \"The Wrestler\", and I think \"The Weather Man\" is the better of the two. I like \"The Wrestler\", but its message comes at you like an elbow pile-driver from the top rope. \"The Weather Man\" is more like a cold wind from Lake Michigan. Really stupid marketing though. \n",

Nothing like sitting down to watch a movie with my family and feeling so embarrassed that I had to get up and leave the room.

Has our society really reached the point where we can constantly accept mediocre garbage as a substitute for thought-provoking entertainment? Everything in this movie seemed flawed...from the writing to the casting. Can someone please explain to me how an American husband and wife raise two children...but one has a British accent? Oh and while I am complaining about the logistics of the movie: why was a plot point of Nicholas Cage's daughter being a smoker introduced? She buys cigarettes, the father sees them in her bag and the point is never touched on again. No resolution? Not even confrontation? Ohhhh I know what you avant-garde cinema heads are thinking...maybe that is the point, right? Maybe it isn't all about the resolution? Well I think it is pointless and boring. Back to logistics, how exactly do these people throwing things at the weatherman have such great accuracy? Not only can these villains recognize Dave Spritz by the back of his head and nail him with food (in a shameless effort to divert eyes away from looking at our watches), these villains are superhuman enough to see Spritz sitting in his car with the window down and accurately throw a big gulp through the window and hit him. Oh and here's something else that ticked me off...how can you cast someone as brilliant as Michael Caine into the role of a genius father figure and give him such horrible dialogue. This world-renowned author and genius father of David Spritz sits in the weatherman's car, picks up a cup and gives the line, \"What's this?\" ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! It is a cup that is most likely filled with residue from soda and it has the words BIG GULP printed so large on the side that Stevie Wonder could read it! The dialogue in this movie is just like the plot. It is weak, thin, very dry, and most of the time it DOES NOT MAKE SENSE! Gore Verbinski I hope you read this because the cut to a 12 year old girl's \"cameltoe\" and then the superimposed real life camel toe was absolutely ridiculous. It was just sooooo stupid! And Nick if you ever read this...just because Adaptation was a good movie doesn't mean you have to keep using voice-over in every movie you take! When a movie is driven by the main character being hit with food and a 12 year old girl's cameltoe you should definitely save your time and money and STEER CLEAR OF THIS MOVIE. \n",

      " David Spritz is a Chicago weatherman who is highly successful with his job but outside of his professional life he is a wreck, with his father that is diagnosed with cancer, his wife on the verge of being engaged with another man, and his kids growing up without him. The movie is excellent. The brilliant direction of Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) and the writing of Steve Conrad mix perfectly in this comedy/drama. The film is also extremely funny and on a couple scenes, I don't think I've ever laughed that hard in any movie, but this. Although it has a high amount of hilarious scenes, the movie is pretty serious and at a point, quite depressing. The acting is amazing and I think Nicolas Cage as David Spritz, should be nominated for an Oscar. This is one of his finest performances. Overall, an excellent comedy that has a great message to show and should be viewed by everyone. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A \n",

It did however succeed in putting me to sleep several times. I really like Nicholas Cage, but it seems I either really like his movies, like Red Rock West and Wild at Heart, just to name two, or I hate them like 8MM or Snake Eyes. While this film tries to be emotionally mature and possess depth, to me the script is superficial and the storyline shallow and boring. Cage's character in particular is inconsistent, a pre-separation scene showing a confident, insensitive self-centered character, other times sniveling and depressed, yet others a concerned sensitive parent. All in all I'd say it is a pseudo-intellectual film made for a pseudo-intellectual audience. \n",

      " .......................................,...............from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL***** May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers ***** The TV promo trailer for \"The Weather Man\" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those \"Light\" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.As the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.While growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been. Similarly, David leaves a lot to be desired in the area of warm and communicative interaction with all the important people in his life: His son, daughter, and of course, his ex- wife. David's disconnect is that he fantasizes that love and affection from his loved ones is linked directly to his level of professional success and recognition.The Weather Man, despite being a great European style film, suffers from some excesses. In order to drive home the fact that David often walks rather aimlessly through life, it isn't indispensable to permit the film to meander and lose its focus for a few minutes as well! Nor do I believe that the constant, non-stop profanity to be consistent with the characters nor with the overall tone of the film. But if you enjoy European flavored cinema and movies which project life through a slightly surreal philosophical prism, surely this Weather Man will make your day",

      " \"The Whether Man\" is a personal favorite much in the mold of \"American Beauty.\" Where the similarities lie are within the story as both Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and Dave Spritz (Nicholas Cage) are both witnessing their lives meeting a cross roads during a midlife crisis. We watch both men deal with their own ways of handling their troublesome lives that are very ordinary and very relatable as they tackle typical family situations. \"American Beauty\" comes off more unrealistic. That film puts Burnham in weird situations that are funny and quirky as he tries to get the most out of life. He reverts back to his teenage days. He fights his midlife crisis with the simple solution of turning into a child. Dave Spritz has a dying father, an overweight daughter, a son that is getting into drugs and finding himself in adult situations and an ex-wife that he wants to get back together with. His ex-wife finds a new boyfriend that is starting to take over the father role that Spritz has title to. Spritz is a man that ignored his family for years and is now paying the consequences. There is a growing distance between he and his family. He finds himself in a depressing state as he starts to hate his job. His father, Robert (Michael Cain), is dying of cancer. Dave does everything he can to fix things. He wants to fix things before his father dies, but nothing goes right for him. He is up for a weatherman job that pays well at \"Hello America\". That will give him enough money to make things right with his family and his wife, and more importantly, receiving the recognition from his father. He wants to fix everything, but cant find the right solution. He assumes a higher paying job would do the trick. The film has very good acting performances ranging from Nicholas Cage in the lead to Michael Cain supporting, as well Hope Davis (Spritz' ex-wife, Noreen). The style of the film is perfect and often a mirror image of Cage and his personality. The direction by Gore Verbinski is what sets the film apart from most. He flawlessly moves from scene to scene; developing all of the characters of the film, and really bringing out numerous metaphors for Dave Spritz. Spritz is well developed and well thought out. Cage has great moments of humor and self examination. Ultimately, \"The Whether Man,\" is a film about the boundaries one person has and his recognition of who he is and his acceptance of of his past mistakes. Spritz has to look in the mirror and realize his limits. He has to accept his capabilities and realize that he can't change everyone. He can't make everyone happy and everyone like him. He can only be the whether man. \n",

      " Nick Cage has made a great many memorable films, but this stinker is not among them. I am sure that this opus came at a time of few suitable scripts coming his way, but he should have suffered the drought rather than submit to this humiliation which his adequate performance could not save.First of all, the story, slim as it is, really has nothing to with weathermen or meteorology, though the term is mentioned once or twice. Instead, this opus is a 'slice of life' look into one man's trials of life and thereby wants to appear noble. Hogwash. It is a mean spirited, voyeuristic gaze into various miseries, and licks its chops at each of the gratuitous profanities and vulgarism which some foul mouthed scripter larded the script. Shame on them, but of course, such would-be writers are beyond shame. Should we fault Cage or noted actor Michael Caine for taking on their thankless roles? Let's just say that they couldn't turn down the millions of dollars the were offered, much as Cages character couldn't turn down the money he was offered which further divorced him from his children and completed this portrait of a looser.How many ways are there to dislike this waste of film and time? Let me count the ways: 1) There was only one scene of bare, bouncing breasts which will be cut from its television showing at absolutely no loss to the trivial story! 2) But wait! Will it ever make it to TV? Not unless they are willing to loop (rerecord) virtually the entire sound track to eliminate all obscenity, vulgarity, and ugliness spewing from almost all the players in almost all their lines. I realize that this is not a 'children's film' but it could have stepped in a sewer to be the all important 'Relevant' without bathing in it.3) Do you know what the epithet \"Camel Toes\" means? Well, unfortunately I now do, and while I had seen its manifestation too many times in life, I was blissfully unaware that some moron had cooked up a term for it. Here the Weatherman's unfortunate daughter is held up to ridicule by it, but not by anyone on screen. She is publicly laughed at by the script! Clearly the asinine and salacious writers expected us to drool along with them in their lechery. The character may have been a sad one, but she deserved better than the slop that was thrown her way.4) Do you like commercials? Well you better, else you will be nauseated by the 100 some Product Placements here as was I. It is bad enough that many of them are visuals with brand logos somehow in view, but what passes for a script forces the actor to mention the brand names dozens of times. Boy, the sponsors must have paid off the producer/studio well for this two hour commercial.5) Do you like mean tricks perpetrated by cowards? Then this flick will be right up your alley, for there many scenes of the hapless Weatherman being pelted with food -- still in their identifiable wrappers (more commercials). This juvenile technique is supposed to garner sympathy for those in the public eye, but the story does each assault with relish (no pun intended) and cruel glee that we are clearly expected to bray along with the miscreants, generating no sympathy for their target Now we will hear of a rash of such incidents in life as depicted, nay, promoted in this sadness.Could this travesty have been saved by better writing? Hardly. There is really no story in this chilly tale set in Chicago in the chilly winter. The production is miserable in all respects, and we come away more miserable for waiting futilely for something nice and human to come along. Disappointment is too mild a word. \n",

      " I am pretty sure when \"The Weather Man\" debuted, there were a lot of confused reactions among the theater patrons. After all, it's nothing like a typical Hollywood or Nicholas Cage movie. In fact, it's the sort of thing many would probably avoid! Now I am not saying it's a bad film...it's just not the sort of thing that would have a wide following. Looking at the gross for this film, it's pretty obvious the film came and went very quickly.The film is about a man who exists. He should be happy, but he isn't and his life is a mess. This weather man from TV (Cage) makes good money, but his ex-wife hates him, his son has a drug problem and his daughter seems lost. Throughout all this, Cage WAY underplays his part--staring a lot and looking very vacant. The music and colors in the film further accentuate that. He obviously feels alienated and it only gets worse as the film progresses--with his father (Michael Caine) being diagnosed with cancer and MANY other problems arising. Yet, oddly, at the same time, his job is going very well. But what's it all for? Sure he makes money and is on TV but he also seems headed for a breakdown--and he has had enough. And, the film sure keeps you guessing as to where it will all end.This film reminds me of Cage's \"Leaving Las Vegas\". It, too, is NOT a film for everyone. Seeing his character drink himself to death in all its vivid glory is hard for most folks to endure. And, after seeing it, I am not even sure if I liked \"The Weather Man\"--as, in a way, he plays a guy who is slowly killing himself. I respect this risk but just thought the film (and his performance) needed more life. Difficult to watch, that's for sure, and its very, very frank language (I sure heard a few interesting words I haven't heard in a long time in this one) will no doubt also alienate many. All in all, I just don't know what to make of this film--and, after almost 13,000 reviews, that's a first! I am sure it's about alienation in modern life and how empty life can be in the western world...odd topics for a corporately produced film stuffed with McDonald's product placement.Very existential and confusing...like real life. \n",

      " This is one depressing film but I mean it in a good way. It's a good movie about character values and one's definition of meaning of life. That is why I find this movie sort of depressing. But, I really liked the film because it is different than most films released today.This is about one Chicago weatherman who is basically having a mid-life crisis dealing with a separation from his wife and children, the disappointment of his terminally-ill father, and fast food getting thrown at him almost daily.Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine put up strong performances in this movie. I kind of thought Cage is a dweeb here at times and needed a good punch in the face. Caine really came through with a powerful performance.Overall, this is a interesting film that reflects on what today's society here in America is like today. I rate this film 8/10. \n",

      " The Weather Man is something tricky to figure out, or at least it was once I finished watching it. It's too dry and awkward to be a comedy in the league of Alexander Payne's male Americana subversive analysis movies, but also not quite at home in a drama due to quirky bits like the Tartar Sauce problem/fight and the running gag of fast food being thrown at \"a fast food man\". But then a comment from a review by David Denby gives reflection on it: \"A middle aged coming-of-age tale\". That's a good way to put it; it's not even really a mid-life crisis story, except maybe for the factor of the sudden archery fixation. It's about a man who has never really found himself entirely despite being a grown man with a ex-wife and two kids and a dying father and well paying but soulless job and doesn't really know who he is. By the end of the story, he may still not totally know, but he's trying, and that's perhaps what counts.The film isn't quite as deep as it thinks, since its makers are still somewhat aiming at a mainstream audience, looking for the human angle while making things light-dark with its star Nicolas Cage, back again in (quasi) oddball mode. But it does have something above other tragic-comedies of the big-studio ilk, which is that there is a raw quality to how people act and talk and look. It was a good and wise choice to have Dave's kids not look like right out of a sitcom: his daughter looks like an average kid, one who gets picked on in just the spot-on comment and tone of the 12 year old world (\"Camel-toe\", funny but alarming goof), and the way she talks and reacts to her father make up for some of the best scenes in the movie. Especially sweet are the scenes where Dave takes her out to get some new dresses.Also very good are scenes between Cage and Michael Caine, who plays his famous writer father who is dying of lymphoma. He's described by his son as being \"Like a rock\", which he doesn't understand until he listens to the song with his son. In their estranged way they are quite close, but distant in the 'apple-falling-far-from-the-tree' aspect. It's great to see Caine in this part, even as for the most part his character's reactions are reduced to \"Hmm, yes, what is a Big Gulp?\" Things like that, and other interactions, make up for a sense of the filmmakers leaning towards the (must use quotes) \"quirky\" behavior and notes of action. Yet other things are alarmingly strange, such as the sort of subplot involving Dave's son caught up with a pederast rehab counselor that he's bonding with. We don't understand why the son is in rehab to start with, just this bizarre bonding that gives the film an added sense of real dread - more for Dave than anybody.The Weather Man is grim and darkly amusing, mostly in its narration from Cage (not his best nor his worst exactly, paling compared to Bringing Out the Dead and Lord of War), either his observations on being a weather man subjected to people asking him about the weekly Spritz report on which say is coldest, or a particularly funny scene where he walks away from beating up someone and wonders if Harriet Tubman got things thrown at her. It's a screenplay that allows for idiosyncrasies that are revelatory, if only for this character at this point in his life. The sense of searching for one's place, in family and relationships and a career, is well laid out in the film, and Gore Verbinski surprises with his deceptively simple direction of the actors and camera-work. If only it could get a little deeper in the dramatic parts- or make things a lot more funny when the tone is set on that as opposed to shifting weirdly in one scene or another scene- it would be really great. \n",

It had a good decent underlying story, but was disjointed and hap hazard the way it was put together. The profanity was extreme and a large part of it was uncalled for and further distracted from the story. Sometimes profanity can be justified to add realism to the situation, but most of it in this movie was just thrown in for lack of a better script. Also the commercial inserts from a wide range of fast food and other products was anything but subtle. I believe they were trying to make their budget by selling product insertions to big business. My wife and I were trying to decide whether to see this or Elizabethtown. Because of my former admiration of Nicolas Cage, I talked her to going to see this movie.

Critics are pissing and moaning about how \"depressing\" it is, which is a total crock. The only person who would find this movie depressing is someone living their life in some hermetically sealed vacuum wherein nothing touches them and they touch nothing. F**k that! The Weather Man is all about accepting the shortcomings you've been handed in life (or created yourself) and dealing with them as best you can and moving on and still finding reasons to be happy with what you have. It isn't morose or depressing or insufferable--it's hilarious and moving and surprisingly deep for a mainstream American movie, which is obviously why so many people despise it.With its casual vulgarity and honest depiction of the ugliness lurking in every layman's heart, it's also a strikingly daring movie, and one that deserves to be seen.

      " In Chicago, Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is the weatherman of the local TV news loved and loathed by the audiences. He is successful in his career making US$ 240,000.00 per year in spite of not having degree in meteorology. However, his personal life is a complete mess: he is a frustrated writer divorced from his wife Noreen (Hope Davis) but he still likes her and wishes to have her back and their marriage work; his sixteen year-old son Mike (Nicholas Hoult) is in rehabilitation for using pot; his clumsy and fat daughter Shelly (Gemmenne de la Peña) is constantly humiliated at school by her mates and pejoratively called \"camel-toe\"; his father Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine) is a distant perfectionist writer and Dave tries to prove his own value to him. When Dave is invited for a test in a national network in New York, his father informs that he has cancer. While trying to resolve his problems and frustrations, Dave grows-up and reaches the necessary maturity to manage the complexities of life.\"The Weather Man\" is a weird and pessimist view of the contemporary American Way of Life. The complex and contradictory lead character is capable of making lots of money just because he can perfectly sell his image to the public without having knowledge about what he is talking; inclusive he is frustrated, feels shallow and compares himself to a fast-food. But he is unsuccessful to have the right attitudes with his family in spite of his best efforts and needy to prove his father his own merits. However, the story is pointless and boring in some moments and in the end I found this movie only reasonable, but with a great potential not well explored by the director. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"O Sol de Cada Manhã\" (\"The Sun of Each Morning\") \n",

      " In one of the most irritating recent movies I have seen, Nicolas Cage plays Dave Spritz, a selfish, clueless Chicago TV weatherman who is not happy with his personal life. I found nothing, absolutely nothing, likable about Spritz. He comes across as shallow and self-involved; he smirks a lot. And on-air, he displays a thoroughly insincere hangdog facial smile that made me want to eject the DVD and break it into a thousand pieces.Yet, this jerk gets paid big bucks on the basis of his on-air persona. Of course, to offer jerks high paying jobs for being jerks is a cultural phenomenon that is so characteristically American. So, in a sense, Dave Spritz is your typical American \"success\" story.The plot and the dialogue are misleading about real-life TV weathermen. The film implies, wrongly, that weathermen know little or nothing about science, and that they work only \"two hours a day, basically reading prompts\". In fact, most TV weathermen must pass tough science tests, and work full days on weather related matters, albeit behind the scenes.The film's plot is redundant. Spritz goes through a series of small emotional events that vary only in outward circumstance. At least thirty to forty minutes of the film could have been axed.Inane is how I would describe the film's dialogue. Secondary characters are insipid, especially the haughty father and the bored daughter. Background music is inconsistent with the intended theme of emotional emptiness. The film's lone laudable element is the color cinematography. Outdoor visuals in particular function well as quasi-art.As someone who is disgusted with all those phony, glib, glitzy, overpaid TV talking heads, I found \"The Weather Man\" painful to watch. It's billed as a comedy. I found nothing in it funny. Next time, Nicolas, pick a better screenplay. \n",

      " There is no other working actor out there who would better convince you that a guy with a lucrative job that only takes him 2hours a day, pays 240K a year , makes him some sort of local celebrity (which is quite big considering that locale is Chicago, IL) and gives him the prospect of even more spectacular job for the morning show \"Hello America\" in NYC, may be as depressed, self-loathing, and confused as Nicolas Cage in the role of David Spritz, the TV Weather Man, and the main character of Gore Verbinsky's 2005 often sad and dark but frank, insightful, and ultimately funny comedy.I believe that the movie was grossly mis-advertised and its trailer pulled the clips out of the content to give a potential viewer the idea of the slapstick comedy with many laughs that come from Cage been thrown at all kinds of fast food by his anti-fans. What some viewers did not expect to see - a somber, dreary and gray looking film and the characters that match the film visual palette perfectly. We will follow David Sprith on the streets of Windy City of Chicago during one never-ending rainy and showy winter while he tries to reconnect with his estranged wife, to understand better his 12-years-old daughter and a teenager son and to get closer to his Pulitzer Prize winner father (Michael Caine), \"the national treasure\" by the words of President Carter, who is dying from lymphoma. The film explores aging, loneliness, longing, emotional crises, and self doubt and more than once brings to mind John Cheever's observation: \"The main emotion of the adult American who has had all the advantages of wealth, education, and culture is disappointment.\" There are a lot of disappointments, regrets and unhappiness in the characters of \"The Weather Man\", especially its main character, David Spritz but the film is not depressing or hopeless thanks to the finesse and artistry of Cage's performance and to his very unique low key dry humor with which he provides the insights in his character's inner world. \"The Weather Man\" is one of the movies that use voice-over effectively and along with Cage, the writer Steve Conrad should be credited for providing the hilarious stream of thought. One of the David's silent monologues, \"Tartar sauce\", is so incredibly funny and masterful that James Joyce himself would've rejoiced had he heard it. Michael Caine deserves equal praise for depth, irony, and a lot of heart that he brings in the role of David's father whose approval David always craved. The last scene between Caine and Cage reminded me of the similar scene between Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in \"The Godfather\" - not because the characters were similar but by its emotional impact and perfect chemistry between two actors. \n",

I can stand in front of a mirror and make morose faces all day long - but it's not good acting. Neither Caine nor Cage displayed the slightest glimmer. The character motivations were incomprehensible and absolutely unbelievable. Arguments escalate and jump from nowhere, and while some might call it 'realistic', I just found it tedious. The dialogue can be atrocious too. A few choice words can be much more effective than an avalanche of profanity, much as the latter is 'realistic'. Also, and I believe another reviewer has mentioned this - why were people chucking food at Nicholas Cage? It was pointless. I get the sense this movie is trying to be some sort of portrayal of the ironies and conflicts of (post?)modern life. It isn't. It's just drab and uninspired. \n",

      " This movie is repulsive. Foul language with every other word. Very dark movie with no redeeming material. Could not follow the purpose of the film. Other foul discussions between the kids in the movie is ridiculous. Makes me leery of renting or attending future Cage films. Cursing adds no value to the film. Walked out in the first ten minutes. Movie ticket prices are high, expect high quality films. Excessive foul language ought to be labeled clearly in advertising to prevent dissatisfaction with movie watching. This is unfortunately the worst movie I've seen in years. I hope that low sales will help Hollywood to rethink the type of films and the content they include in their movie productions. Highly recommend you pass on this one. \n",

The characters don't really seem to change that much, so they start out as they mean to carry on, though there is an exceptance that things will be what they will be at the end. But thats it. I was hoping for something to lift my spirits, but I ended up wanting to leave after 15 minutes but me and a friend both stuck it out until the end just in case it got better - sadly it didn't.

      " I went to see this movie because it was billed as a comedy/drama and because Nicolas Cage was in it. I was disappointed from the very beginning. The foul language was unnecessary and the conversations were curt to the point of frustration. The one sexual scene seemed gratuitous and also unnecessary. The entire movie was more depressing than funny and it left me feeling lousy when it was over. I find it hard to believe that anyone would spend the energy, time or expense to put such a pointless, depressing story on film. This movie ranks near the top of my list of the worst movies I've ever spent money to see. I'm not sure what kept me from walking out of the theater.

      " Being honest with you, I wanted this movie to be great. I wanted it to simply blow me away. So my view going into the theater was somewhat fixed on it being a good movie. I was not let down.The movie began somewhat slow but quickly picked up some steam. We were taken on a journey to the mind of David Spritz or the weather man. During the movie David has many things to deal with, including his own mind, which at times works against him. He struggles to \"get it together\" and at the same time deal with the possibility of a new (better paying) job at a station in New York. Nick Cage really shines as David Spritz and pretty much every one around him does great also. Of course not all movies are perfect; I felt that some of the language could have been done without and that a few plots that were interesting but not matured enough to simply end them. I wish they would have been taken further. If you like different, interesting character pieces then this movie is for you. I left the theater with a new look on my life and what is really important and a ton of cool phrases. Some people will get it, others won't. Enjoy. \n",

There is no conventional plot arc, no issues that get resolved, no singular antagonist. It has the kind of story line that you don't usually see in popular film, and people expecting something more a long the lines of Cage's usual roles will be very disappointed.The only part of this movie that would keep me from suggesting it to others is the overuse of foul language. Yes, it establishes his character, but it feels like a cheap way to do so. Remove the constant swearing and the brief nudity and this film could easily have received a PG-13 rating. \n",

      " \"How you spend your time is more important than how you spend your money. Money mistakes can be corrected, but time is gone forever.\" -- David Norris I don't know who David Norris is, but his quote sure hits home. After a week-long vacation in the mountains of Arizona, walking the dusty Western streets of Mescal and Old Tucson Studios where so many classics have been filmed, I come back and force myself to sit through tripe like this? If The Weather Man accomplished anything it was to cause me to reevaluate what I waste my time on. I may have seen the movie for free, but it stripped me of 100 minutes of my life, and I'll never get it back. It's gone. Forever. I could cry.The tagline for The Weather Man tries to be cute by playing on the weather theme and states, \"bring an umbrella.\" Well, allow me to be cute and suggest bringing a pillow instead. A blanket might also be nice. Or better yet, save your time and money and skip this one completely. And believe me; the weather theme doesn't stop with the tagline. Oh no, it must saturate (see what I did there?) the screen! I have no doubt that there will be a few beatniks out there who'll drool over the sage parallels regarding life and weather and how both are equally unpredictable and hard to control. To that I say balderdash. Balderdash, I say! Sure, life comes with its share of surprises, but it's certainly easier to control than the weather. Regardless, the movie doesn't even present these correlations in an interesting or compelling manner. Had it been able to do that (or at least given me a likable lead character to root for) then I would have been more than happy to lend a listening ear. Instead, it tries way too hard to sound more philosophical than it actually is and only made me want to rest my previously mentioned ear on the cool under side of an eider down pillow.For example, I'm sure Verbinski wanted us to stand up and applaud as Cage shrewdly analyzes the fast, easy, non-nutritional qualities of fast food. Cage stating (in his mind), \"I'm fast food,\" seems designed to be a life-changing revelation, but it's nothing more than a chuckle-inducing awkward line. Sure thing Cage, and my mother's a fish. You'll need to have read As I Lay Dying to get the reference. Don't worry; both statements are of equal faux significance.Despite a few funny moments (the montage of Cage having all sorts of fast food items thrown at him being the best), I was as bored as Nicolas Cage looks the entire movie. Why should I invest much care into Cage's character when he doesn't even seem to give a monkey nip about what's going on? Yeah, yeah, life's a big ol' piece of dog poop for him, but COME ON! Show a little emotion.I get it, this is a story about a man who walks around depressed, talks about his depression through narration, uses the \"f\" word a lot, and basically makes the audience as depressed as he is. I suppose my detractors will tell me his lack of emotion represents some sort of near-comatose state that he has been forced into due to his lack of really knowing who he is and what it's like to be alive. Hey, if over-analyzing crap like that sounds like your idea of a good time then you obviously have lower requirements for amusement than I do. Just excuse me while I yawn in your face and say, \"Yeah, whatever.\" I have come to the conclusion that I have far better things to do with my time than to watch a movie where a father has a disturbing conversation with his 12-year-old daughter about \"camel toe.\" I also don't need to be disgusted by watching this same 12-year-old accidentally walk in on an oral sex discussion between her parents.\"But that's real life, Johnny! Those scenes were uncomfortable, but that's just because life is so uncomfortable! This is deep stuff man, deep stuff!\" Uh-huh. Real life can be pretty boring also, so I guess the movie was trying to capture that aspect. Good job! Success! It's too bad that the movie seats were as uncomfortable as some of the subject matter; that prevented me from getting more sleep than I did.Cage, obviously in no mood to endear himself to real weathermen, points out multiple times that there's nothing to the weather - it's just wind blowing around. Sounds kind of like the movie's story, or lack thereof. There really isn't anything to it, nothing to follow. Cage is just a man complaining about life while trying to find exactly what his life should be about.Trust me when I say that if you usually find yourself agreeing with my movie tastes then The Weather Man is not one you will want to give either your time or money. As the end credits roll the only thing you're likely to think about is how you were just stripped of 100 minutes of your life, and you'll never get it back. It's gone. Forever. You just might cry. \n",

Michael Caine also had some interesting moments. There are some moments of comedy and they are enjoyable.The weatherman does what it is supposed to. It tells the story of someone whose life didn't go as he planned, and it tells it well.People have and will complain that The Weather Man is a depressing movie. This doesn't mean it isn't good. It's nice to see a movie that doesn't hide anything for fear that the audience will disagree with it. There is a lot of profanity, but let's see what you say when your life is like this and people pelt food at you.I liked this film enough to give it an 8/10.

      " 'The Weather Man' – a film about the life and times of a Chicago news weather man, or the last decent film Nicholas Cage has made (to date). It's up to you to decide. Once upon a time Cage was Box Office dynamite. Nowadays, his star has shone on the 'direct-to-DVD' market and has become synonymous with over-acting and that awful remake of 'The Wicker Man.' However, back in the day he used to be pretty good. Here, his 'over-acting' is turned down a notch or two and he does what he does best – give a decent performance. He plays a down-on-his-luck weather man for a (not particularly prestigious TV station. Just because he gets the occasional perk of being a – minor – celebrity, doesn't mean his life is going that well. His wife has left him and kept the kids and house, his dad (wonderfully played by Michael Caine – sporting an unusual American accent) is pretty aloof, people keep throwing fast food at him on the street and the least said about his estranged kids the better. Therefore, despite his apparently privileged lifestyle, he still has plenty to complain about.I really enjoyed this film, which Cage bears completely on his shoulders. I really do think it's his (last) best performance. If there is one criticism that might be levelled at the film it's that it's a little 'unfocused.' The story doesn't really go anywhere as it's mainly about following his life as he tries to",
      " well, just go about his day to day business. There's no real 'beginning, middle and end' as there is with most standard Hollywood films.It's a 'bittersweet' drama that borders on black comedy. So, if you're a fan of Cage at his best, or just like dark family dramas which have a touch of social commentary and don't necessarily go anywhere, you should get something out of this one. Alas, poor Nick we remember him fondly. \n",

He is frustrated, cumbersome and trying so hard he wrecks more than he mends. The movie is well written and while classified a comedy I would more call it a dramedy as its pretty dark with a dry sense of humour throughout.Cage plays Dave Spritz, a frustrated TV weatherman in Chicago, where he makes good money for a job that demands little effort. In an ongoing voice-over Spritz describes his life and how viewers of his weather reports often throw things at him on the street, mostly food related.He's divorced from his wife, has a strained relationship with his 2 children (which he's trying to repair) especially his daughter who is overweight, detached and the other kids call Cameltoe. His father is a respected author (although Dave failed at his own attempt to write a book) with ill heath so this is yet another relationship he is trying to mend. Throughout Dave is also trying to land a dream job at the network in New York, which the highs and (mostly) lows of his stormy personal life may impact his chances of getting.I found some aspects of this story very unique, enjoyed the scenes with Dave and his daughter, the bow lessons, dress shopping and Michael Caine was a treat as Cage's disapproving, perfectionist father. 9/26/15 \n",

His daughter Shelly is chubby and abandons her archery. He decides to take up her bow and arrow for himself.The humor is dark and dry. The monotone and the bluish hue keeps everything down.

Nicholas Cage has done some (in my opinion) lame films recently so I stopped watching things with him in but this is an exceptional performance by him. Michael Cane is also fairly good as a supporting actor. The film has a great combination of dark and warm themes with some excellent comedy in. The themes mainly revolve around relationships, family and career success addressing how hard it is to balance all three from the eyes of a man that has got it completely wrong for the last decade. The film is an incredibly funny and grim account of how 'the weatherman' tries to reincorporate his children and ex-wife into his immensely successful life. There is a lot of comedy around how local celebrities are treated and a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Nicholas Cage isn't a comedian but he executes the writing well and reacts excellently to the jokes that he is the but of. 8/10 \n",

And once things did start to happen, I was taken along for a while; only to be disappointed once again by the inexplicably weak ending.Definitely one for those who like their movies on the strange side; but not my cup of tea I'm afraid. \n",

But The Weather Man is not that either.I found this movie to be:a. trendy, in both the way it looked (the cold-blue \"fluorescent\" look which will probably seem quite dated in twenty years) and its soundtrack (pseudo-indie).b. self-important, meaning that many a badly written piece of narration was made out to be an earth-shattering realization.c. self-indulgent, including gratuitous sex, pedophilia, archery, and adolescent camel toe. Actually, most everything that could be billed as \"quirky\" in the film was gratuitous.d. totally unpleasant and negative, and dare I say cruel?

      " David Spritz (Nicholas Cage) is a Chicago Weatherman whose career is blossoming and fruitful (to the tune of over $100 000 a year), but who is a complete failure in every other aspect of life. He lives in the shadow of his Pulitzer-Prize winning Father, Robert (Michael Caine) and his attempts to follow in Robert's footsteps as a novelist are not blessed with success. His estranged wife Noreen (Hope Davis) is considering divorce and his attempts to reconcile are not blessed with success. His daughter Shelley (Gemmenne de la Peña) and son Mike (Nicholas Hoult) are both experiencing frighteningly mature reality while he struggles to relate by taking them out and buying them things, but he doesn't feel he's getting any where in any facets of his personal life. To top it all off, he regularly has fast food thrown at him by the public with the insulting exclamation of \"Hey, Weatherman!\" and his father has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. The story sees David attempt to resurrect his family life and secure a happy ending before his father dies.\"The Weather Man\" could be described as an inner-city \"American Beauty\". Both films explore the struggles of men undergoing mid-life crises, and both use first-person narration and striking cinematography, as well as a balance of interesting, interactive characters as seen through the eyes of a central protagonist. The difference lies in the tone; \"American Beauty\" was a masterful blend of humor and melancholy, where as \"Weather Man\" is a not-so-balanced blend of humor and absolute misery. This causes a slight problem, not because it makes the viewer feel miserable (although it may well do so), but because it makes it hard to explain just why it is one would want to watch it. It's important to understand that the film has, in this viewer's opinion, many redeeming qualities; the direction, the afore-mentioned cinematography, the score, to say nothing of the fine performances. What's also important to understand is that these things are not necessarily going to guarantee an enjoyable experience. The fact is that David Spritz is a desperately miserable man, surrounded by a mass of misery and, unlike in \"A.B.\", the wit and touching honesty of the both the writing and acting never fully overwhelm that misery.What this means essentially is that it is then up to the viewer to see past that misery to the positive qualities that the film has to offer; of which, rest-assured, there are many. Gore Verbinski's direction is one; for those who have seen 'The Ring' or 'Pirates of the Caribbean' this will undoubtedly be a huge shock. It is a film most unlike any other Verbinski has done, but what's more impressive is that he handles it so differently. He pays attention to things that we would have not given a second thought to otherwise, and in doing so helps bring out the symbolism and sympathy in what otherwise might just be a bizarre story. Working with him on this is Phedon Papamichael, whose cinematography highlights the glum winter of Chicago (the weather playing an obvious ironic role) in a strangely beautiful light. Touches like these make one think twice before dismissing the film as",
      " well, just about anything.The mood established by the tasteful work of Verbinski and Papamichael is greatly refined by Cage's narrative voice-over. Dave Spritz' own thoughts reflect perhaps more than anything else just how readily, even seamlessly the film changes from funny to sad. \"(It's) always fast food\" he muses rather wistfully, after one of his many incidents with projectile take-away \"Sh*t people would rather throw out than finish. It's easy, it tastes alright, but it doesn't really provide you with any nourishment.\" Such odd observational humor almost seems suited to the film's idiosyncratic style; then he dejectedly adds, \"I'm fast food\" and it becomes perfectly suited. This mood is a direct result of a film that understands how one man's joke is another's pain: What would happen if the Weather Man on TV was really just that and nothing more? He'd be a living joke",
      " and in practice that is a truly tragic existence.All this strangeness may seem like its ready to fall apart, but never-fear, because at the centre of it all, keeping it together is the sensational Nicholas Cage. Cage has made some very interesting, some ill-advised choices in his career. He has played buff ex-convicts (Con Air), obsessive-compulsive, agoraphobic con-artists (Matchstick Men), even the villain and the hero in the same film (Face Off). To date, however, none of these compare to the oddity that is David Spritz. Perhaps the most amazing thing about his performance is the degree of sympathy he is able to generate for a rather unlikable character, one who reverts to insults instinctually and doesn't like to talk to members of the public when recognized, one who betrays trust and lets down his wife and then claims he is trying to \"make things work\". The sympathy we feel then, is not really for the written character so much as Cage, and this may be because he makes us feel that he really, truly does want to \"make things work\", even if it is purely in his own interests. Or maybe it's just because it's natural to feel sorry for one as hopelessly pathetic as Cage appears to be in this film; either way it is a remarkable acting accomplishment from an increasingly remarkable actor.It's not hard to see why audiences were stupendously under whelmed with \"The Weather Man\"; it's a film about a miserable man with a depressing life for whom almost everything goes wrong and it set in Chicago during winter. Behind all this, however, lies a rather fantastically unique display of many talents, all of which have executed their roles to near perfection and in doing so created an exceptionally rare type of film. If for no other reason than this, \"The Weather Man\" deserves sincere respect. \n",

      " This is an enjoyable, quirky little film despite the fact that nothing much really happens. Centering on the lead character's relationship with his father and his own trials and tribulations with his own kids this is a movie that tries a little too hard to be quirky and off-beat.Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments, a few laughs and a little pathos but what surprised me most was seeing Nicholas Hoult as Nic Cage's son. The British child actor who played the boy in \"About A Boy\" does a very convincing American accent, the same however cannot be said for Michael Caine whose accent seems to get worse the more Americans he plays.I have to admit that the title performance by Cage as the constantly frustrated weather man is, as always, excellent. Again I'd say this movie was enjoyable without being spectacular, a victim of its own self consciousness when it had the potential to be excellent.http://seetocher.blogspot.com/ \n",

      " It takes a lot for me to turn a film off. I feel obligated to finish what I start, not to mention losing the hard-earned money I spent on renting a movie or going to the theater and paying up. But I didn't have to turn off THE WEATHER MAN. It was a close call, though. My finger hovered over my remote's \"stop\" button several times.For me, a film has to have some sort of message (be it of happiness, despair, anguish, social/political, family value ...something), but THE WEATHER MAN appears to have none. For those of you who love pessimism, you might find some enjoyment in this flick. But not me. I have a bit more upbeat look on life.I'm actually a fan of Nicholas Cage (loved him in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and LORD OF WAR), but in this film Cage and director Gore Verbinski go over the edge and over the top.Nick Cage plays David Spritz, a weather man for a local Chicago TV station. Living in Chicago and having this kind of a job is not what it's cracked up to be. Illinois' weather is some of the most unpredictable in the nation, going from below freezing one day to 80-plus the next. So David gets picked on regularly by citizens of the windy city (mostly they throw things at him ...like sodas, shakes, hot apple pies, etc.). To add to his sour life, he's in the process of a divorce with his wife Noreen (Hope Davis) and having to deal with his two children who are rushing into adulthood  his 12-year-old daughter smokes and his 15-year-old son just came out of drug rehab. And now, to put icing on the icing, his father (played by the estimable Michael Caine) is dying of lymphoma.All of these terrible things swirl around David Spritz, similar to the unpredictable weather. But all doesn't seem hopeless. He's gotten a job offer on a national TV show (think Good Morning America) but he can't see the good in it. With life in Chicago falling apart, David is ready to shoot somebody. Anybody. Oh yes, did I mention that he's been practicing archery and carries around a bow and arrow now? Don't mess with the weather man.Labeled as a \"comedy/drama,\" the focus is definitely more on the drama than the comedy. Black comedies do appeal to me (I gushed over THE MATADOR), but they need a pretty defined center that an audience can identify with. You're not going to find that here. And it's really a shame, because I felt THE WEATHER MAN could've been an excellent film, but as it stands now it's just a mesh of depressing scenes with no focal point. \n",

      " Nicholas Cage gives a mediocre performance as a Chicago weatherman struggling to make sense of life--his almost non-existent relationship with his father, his strained relationship with his ex-wife and his awkward relationship with his children. Along the way, the poor weatherman gets various food items thrown at him from the disliking public. The audience is not sure why this happens and quite frankly we don't really care. His character is never fully developed enough to understand how he got to where his is, how he can pull himself out and even if he really does at the end. There are some humorous and touching moments throughout but again still not enough that anyone cares. In the end, I felt sorrier for his children who have the weatherman their father. Michael Caine should have been nominated for an Academy Award for his support role--he was unrecognizable as the weatherman's stoic, quiet, Pulitzer prize-winning father. \n",

      " I had to stop watching this film because I was just disgusted. Based on the previews, one would think this was an excellent movie that all the family could enjoy; however, the R rating is definitely deserved because of all of the sexual content. We know how Erin Brockovitch had the \"F\"- word at least ten times a scene? This is worse.I will admit that there were a few mildly comical parts, but some of the themes were just completely unnecessary. It could have been a better movie if there was a lack of the sexual content because it still would have been about a guy that no one liked. He could still have random beverages thrown at him and it would have been totally fine. But the graphic sexual content just ruined the film entirely.Personally, I think a different approach should have been taken in the writing of this film, but that is not the fault of the actors or director, for the direction it was going before I stopped watching was decent and Michael Caine is such an excellent actor. But even his classicness was soiled by the script.Don't bother watching it, it is disgusting. \n",

      " David Spritz (Cage) is a successful TV weatherman, but has less success in his personal life.There are several actors I really enjoy watching and Nicolas Cage is one of them. To me he is a natural as are the others I like to watch. Here he is a TV Weatherman who can sometimes get a forecast wrong and still keep his job and I guess we all understand that. But to get things wrong in life is another matter. Yet he continues to try to make things right. Well, it's one thing to get things wrong in life if all make an effort to correct things, but it's another thing when there is no forgiveness because there is no love. He is divorced from his wife (Davis),who shows no love at all and neither do his children. His father (Caine) barely puts up with him. Where did all this go wrong? The movie never really gives us an answer. David seems to be an okay, knowing, and hip kind of guy, but somewhere in the marriage something went very wrong. Maybe it was a long series of his not focusing in on family matters when he had the opportunity. Maybe.This could have been funnier but it wasn't although it did have a few snickers like when David throws a snowball at his wife to lighten things up and hits her square in the face. Of course, she says: what the hell are you doing? And, he replies: you turned into it.There is a lot of dirty talk by the children, and adults. Some of the sexual imagery and language were way too crude for the movie which calls itself a Comedy. I haven't heard some of those words for years and they will not be repeated here.

      " David Spritz(Nicolass Cage,shifting from clean-cut and bright to dark and sallow with ease in the SAME MOVIE!)is a successful Chicago weatherman whose charm and presence at his job has allowed him professionally coast,but whose alternate lack of ease with domestic life or his low self-esteem vis-a-vis his accomplished author father(Michael Caine,a quiet,knowing presence in a film that seems to be the exact opposite of him)has had him inside of his own mental and psychological shell for too long. A chance at becoming the weatherman on the nationally broadcast network morning show is the golden ring,the coveted prize of Dave Spritz' self-realized yet hopelessly rutted universe.I was prepared to think this movie to be nothing more than a vaguely entertaining,fairly disappointing exercise in film,but what I got was an interesting,sometimes heartbreaking,other time frustrating serio-comedy. The best part of this comes clearly from the fact that Cage,who really IS a very engaging and talented actor,gets a chance to show this off once more after years of being mostly sad-faced action heroes in brain-restricted films(Next,Ghost Rider,National Treasure 1 and 2,most recently). As the main character and narrator,there's a chance for him to be sort of a all-knowing,film noir type over-looker into the film's heart and mind,and this style largely works. The supporting cast is good,if perhaps not overwhelmingly impressive. Caine,Hope Davis(as Cage's ex,a confused and humorless buzz-kill)are par for the course;Cage's character's kids(Gemmenne de la Pena and Nicholas Hoult)seem real enough,albeit not particularly engaging,same for Michael Rispoli as Davis' new hubby;and Gil Bellows is disturbingly effective as the predator who's eying Cage's son.Director Gore Verbinsky would not have been my first choice to direct this,but he seems to be able to free himself from the usual strum-and-drang style of film-making that he's made his fortune to make this much more still-life,more nuanced,dark film that has comic undertones(which the producers of this film seemed to think they had to underscore,which might explain the show's lack of either commercial or critical reception).Writer Steven Cross made an interesting--although sometimes tough to make heads or tails of--screenplay.While I cannot truly say I loved this film(heck,there were parts that were tough just to like!),I thought this was an overall solid effort. A film like this,dark,funny,yet painful and true is one that I wish Mr.Cage would do more of(though I KNOW those don't pay the bills the way actioners do),and if I were his agent I'd be steering him toward. \n",

      " Up until seeing The Weather Man, I had maintained Nicolas Cage had only been in one decent film this entire decade and that was Adaptation. The Weather Man has proved me wrong, in the sense he's actually been in two particularly good films this decade with The Weather Man really standing out. It's always going to create speculative opinions when a film tries to tackle the issues surrounding mid-life crisis' or a human-being in need as his life threatens to fall apart and the whole thing is played for laughs of some sort. Fortunately, The Weather Man finds its spot between success and failure in this retrospect, delivering a film that is engrossing; interesting; funny but never exploitative.I think part of the reason The Weather Man is such a good film is because it finds this balance, with the film-making aspect of it backing it up rather than becoming obviously apparent. Items such as Michael Caine's character's reaction to certain things more-so his dodgy accent aid in getting across a humorous moment or two and a lot of Nicolas Cage's voiceovers complete with flashbacks are less so 'laugh out loud' funny and are more sombre due to their sad and somewhat pathetic nature. It also works in the sense we know exactly what happens next in his life and thus, if the entire film, including flashbacks, had been presented in a linear form the film would have been attempting to exploit a man's life crisis by way of comedy.As for Nicolas Cage, he plays David Spitz who's the weather man of the title but it could really be any individual in almost any job and that's part of the brilliance of the film. David struggles in balancing his rocky relationship with his wife Noreen (Davis) as she begins a new one with someone else; his relationship with his daughter Shelley (de la Peña) as she struggles in a world obsessed with fashion, what's 'hot' and beauty in general and he also tries to balance his son's, named Mike (Hoult), misfortunes after he has a dangerous encounter with a paedophile. All the time this goes on, he tries to come across as a decent individual to his own father, Robert (Caine).But the film isn't a quick fire, multi-strand picture flipping from one story and situation to the next. The Weather Man takes time in its setting up of events and certain situations that develop; sometimes pausing to place them on a backburner to concentrate on another thing entirely. This can be a bullying problem that arises for Shelley; David's new job opportunity that arises in another city or his gradual interest in archery. The Weather Man is shot in a dark and snowy location, using greys and other metallic colours perfectly to get across a feeling of feint despair; a feeling that any tilt either way could result in either full blown Technicolor or out and out black and white for a depressing effect.The film begins with a series of odd camera compositions, setting up the tone and the visualisation of the film perfectly. The traffic is strangely symmetrical; pictures on the sides of walls seems to make their own way backwards as certain actions are undertaken in an impressive example of focus pulling and when we see David standing in a room, the on television is at the side of the screen thus presenting David as an individual distancing himself from the active world or the activity that is clearly going on in his immediate vicinity. But from here, the film delves into what it's like to be a father or an individual that is trying to balance too many things at once. As a presence, David's father Robert is someone that shows up at the worst of times and has prior success already under his belt in a Pulitzer prize. His look on life and opinions of David's own come across as calm and obvious, further embedding David with issues that are made to come across as quite easy to deal with.So the film is about a man trying to seek recognition from his father whilst attempting to be a good one all the same. The issues with Shelley in the sense she is a 12 year old girl that swears, smokes and wants to kill animals provide David with an overall goal in which he must achieve, at least for Shelley's sake much-less his own and the sub-stories revolving around Mike's issues are dealt with enough but never feel like they are dominating proceedings. Another piece of evidence of the film's neutral tone see it set up its product placement of McDonalds before bashing the chain and fast-food in general as 'non-nourishing' before allowing its lead to recognise that it's only ever fast-food people throw at him. He does this whilst sitting in a fast-food restaurant.As a stand alone film, The Weather Man suffices on multiple levels. It's a comedy of sorts albeit thanks to a lot of Caine's downbeat and lateral observations on life without ever feeling like an obvious comedy; it carries a certain degree of menace as Cage's character gradually has things pile on top of him, rendering his position seemingly impossible to recover from and it allows each character and certain scenario to arrive, settle and then expand again if the film so wishes it to. I just wonder if Cage will indeed make a better film this decade or if director Verbinski will ever be remembered for this film amongst all his inglorious 'Pirates' exploits. If neither happen, then that would be a great shame. \n",

      " Loved this movie. It really makes you think about your own life, and evaluate who you are.Does how much you make a difference, does it matter whether you are really good at something, however insignificant it may be to others, does it matter what others think about you, or is it about how happy and well adjusted your family is, or is it whether you are a success in the eyes of those who you respect, like your parents. What are your relationships based upon, love, dependence, habit ? What is a fulfilling job or relationship worth.While this is a rather dark introspective movie, a lot of scenes were simply hilarious without being comic. You tend to identify with the blundering father who seems to try so hard but not get anything right. You see him be a jerk to his wife, but can tell it is in ways that are fairly common.A very honest movie. \n",

      " The Weather Man reminded me a lot of Sideways. It is the tale of an ordinary guy in a less-than-great job trying unsuccessfully to handle the break-up of his marriage while dealing with \"other s#*t.\" In both films, the protagonists are failed novelists. The themes are easy to relate to (well, if you're me). Why aren't I doing better than I am? How can I make my Dad proud of me? What happens when he is gone? Why am I in middle-age and small stuff still gets to me? I see from other posts that this was marketed as a comedy. In Japan, the marketing often bypasses me, but if they are selling this as comedy they are doing the filmmakers a disservice. It is certainly funny - the tartar sauce episode will have men everywhere cringing. But it is so much more than that, containing a humanism and compassion for the little guy that is touching and welcome. But having said that, this is painful to watch at times. Nicholas Cage continues to surprise with his range - I think this is his best performance bar Adapted. Michael Caine is solid, though his American accent shows the Americans are still doing Brit accents better than we are doing theirs (Ewan McGregor, take note). A gem of a film. \n",

      " This film will crystallize the stresses of modern life for many of its viewers.Nicholas Cage plays Dave Spritz, a local TV weather man, whose life is almost dysfunctional on every level. Although he is handsomely paid, his job holds no satisfaction; he is separated from his wife and children; and his father (masterfully played by Michael Caine) has a crisis of his own.Spritz seems to stumble through life with every one of his problems becoming too much to deal with, and indeed his pathetic attempts to address issues seem to make circumstances even worse. His desire to assist his children to have happy and fulfilling lives causes them all sorts of angst, and his attempts to reconcile with his wife are abject failures.In the midst of these problems, which by now have snowballed into one massive dilemma, he receives a job offer which would take him to a national network with a much higher salary. He is tempted to take his family to New York and start afresh.If you watch this movie wanting a schmaltzy feel-good ending, you'll wish you had taken out Mary Poppins. But if you want to take a look at the harried middle classes who seemingly have every material wealth but not much love or satisfaction in their lives, this could be for you.Cage does a passable job as the hassled and inept protagonist David Spritz, but the movie takes a long time to get where it is going. \n",

The acting is abysmal, even from Michael Caine, easily the world's current Olivier. Nothing in the film comes close to suggesting a cohesive story, the family displays not the slightest connection to one another (other than a slight physical resemblance between Caine and Cage. The children not only don't resemble their \"parents\", they also don't resemble each other, or even any child in reality. What kid would be so un-street smart (in Chicago of all places) as to not spot a pedophile when he offers to snap pictures of the boy, and offers him an expensive camera 'just because'? The film abounds with illogical actions of the characters, just to set up an improbable, unimaginative \"punchline\". An example of this is when Cage sits by a street in Chicago for an extended period of time with his window open, in a snow storm. Why does he have his window open in freezing weather? So someone can throw a Big Gulp with amazing accuracy, striking him in the side of the head. Is that funny? No. He doesn't even react with any emotion approaching the comedic. Yet this obvious and futile attempt at humor is a benchmark for the 'laughs' to come.The only reason anyone would laugh at this, would be if they are low class enough to think that two divorced people discussing oral sex in front of their own children constitutes comedy, or if they find the phrase \"camel toe\" to be the hight of hilarity. Something could have been made of this basic story (man's success in career comes at the expense of his home life), but nothing that could have been made of it, even trite, overused clichés from other bad comedies weren't used here.I'll be watching carefully for this film's writer's work in the future.

      " Chicago weather man David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is in the middle of a mid-life crisis. He just recently got divorced from his wife Noreen (Hope Davis) and to top it off his two children Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena) and Mike (Nicholas Hoult) have just entered their teenage years. David not only has to deal with his ex wife and his kids but also live up to his father Robert Sprtiz (Michael Caine) reputation because he was the ideal and perfect father.It's a real shame this movie didn't do well at the box office because this movie was terrific. What I liked most about the movie was the fact that the story was told from a very interesting perspective. The film felt fresh and different than most mainstream flicks. The movie is definitely not a very upbeat one but at times you do laugh or chuckle and the jokes seem to be perfectly timed as well. This movie deals with all kinds of issues that occur in real life including marriage, divorce, how hard it is to connect with your kids when they enter into their teenage years, and just many issues that go with life in general. The movie is very much like a smaller independent film and it really does have that touch which could be why it didn't to do well this past weekend.It's sad to see that most typical movie-goers can't appreciate a movie like \"The Weather Man.\" Most typical movie-goers will say this film is too depressing. I appreciate the fact that the movie is depressing because I can't tell you how many times I watch movies and in the end say that was good but is so unrealistic. When you watch this film, the people you see in the film are real and are people you see on a normal basis. Maybe they don't read the weather for a living but many people can relate to the characters on screen because the situations are so realistic and are situations that either yourself or someone you known at one point in time have gone through.Nicolas Cage has been doing some of the best work of his career over the past few years with movies like \"Adaptation\", \"Matchstick Men\", \"Lord of War\", and now \"Weather Man\" I can safely say he is one actor who I will now run out on opening day to see his next film as long as he keeps making these good films. The problem here lies that all the films I just mentioned are great movies however do poorly at the box office. Like I said earlier most people would rather see something like \"War of the Worlds\" then something with a good story, good acting and some substance. Also all supporting actors did a fine job as well. Hope Davis who is usually an independent film gal was terrific as the frustrated ex-wife, Michael Caine played the father role perfectly, The daughter Shelly played by Gemmenne de la Pena was also very good, and finally Nicholas Hoult (Believe it or not this is the little boy from the Hugh Grant film \"About a Boy\") played David's son was also very good as the troubled son. This movie was directed by Gore Verbinski who is best known to the world as the director of \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" And I must say its nice to see that someone like this guy exists in the world someone who can go from making a big budget popcorn movie to make a smaller crafted drama. I am truly amazed that Mr. Verbinski pulled this movie off so perfectly because he uses such interesting settings and camera shots to pick up the characters emotions and feelings. I really dug his directing style on this film.In the end, \"The Weather Man\" is almost perfect as a character study and as a dramatic film. The only problem that I realized with the film was they never really focused on the problem that David's son Mike had. I mean he was seeing a counselor but it was never explained why. Other than that, there really wasn't anything I didn't like about the film. And as I previously mentioned, the film is very realistic, the acting is solid, and the story is unique and uniquely told. The movie doesn't end completely depressing but in a more realistic sense. Many will complain that the movie isn't upbeat or doesn't end in a truly happy manner and I would say to them that's reality.MovieManMenzel's final rating for the Weather Man is a 9.5/10. For those who like realistic and smart movies make this your must see film the next time you visit the theater. \n",

      " The cinematography in this movie is exceptional, including the composition of the shots. Many of the angles are unusual -- in a good way. And it shows off Chicago beautifully.Nicolas Cage spends much of the movie with a dour look on his face and he's not a barrel of laughs here, but the movie does have its humorous moments, mostly at his expense. (The scene with his ex-wife, the excellent Hope Davis, shouting at him outside her front door about midway through the movie is touchingly hilarious.) He can't seem to do anything right at first and I did empathize with him but also initially felt a sense of \"Loser!\" about him. Fortunately, not for the whole movie.It's Cage's story, about a man who hopes to put his troubled family back together while dealing with his own and family members' various issues and going for a job in New York. Bryant Gumbel's cameo adds to the credibility of the premise.The actors bring the script alive and help to overcome some of its weaker moments. It's definitely a complex movie focusing on complex issues involving complex people. His kids aren't perfect and they're not fakely smart-alecky either. His father, played with just the right combination of love and disappointment by Michael Caine, isn't all bad or all good. His ex-wife isn't overly hostile or overly unsympathetic. How refreshing, all of that! I doubt that the critics will like this movie much -- already some of the buzz in the crowd at the NY premier (which I was able to attend, albeit in the nosebleed seats, thanks to my movie class leader) was negative. It's just not a typical Hollywood fairy tale -- it's more about real life. But at least they tackled it sincerely and I think it turned out well. \n",

      " There's nothing cunning about the approach taken in \"The Weather Man\". It isolates us in one man's depressive vacuum of bloat and helplessness, yet it never digs deeper to become a meaningful treatise on Life, and the lead performance seems to encourage that. Nicolas Cage plays a Chicago weather announcer on TV who considers his job a fast-food fix for storm-watchers; a reluctant chump, he wants to impress his father (a Pulitzer-Prize winning writer) with talk of a novel, and he tries staying close to his two kids with his ex-wife, but the unrealistic hope of bringing everyone together is constantly stalled by his own sudden fits of anger and irritation over his life going sour. The movie seems to be about the masks we have to wear (or choose to wear), but, curiously rather than intriguingly, there's nothing going on underneath. Cage takes this man's despair and puts a blank face on it; he is strenuously low-keyed. His voice a boyish monotone, Cage is successful in the scenes with his daughter (a pre-teen schlub), but overall his work seems blobby, shapeless. Michael Caine is an interesting choice as his father, and Caine underplays nicely, but nothing is at risk or resolved in this relationship. Many elements of the weather man's life are relatable to a large audience, but director Gore Verbinski and writer Steve Conrad seal this world off, to such a degree that even a big network job Cage is hoping for doesn't seem likely or exciting (I was thinking the network would be better off choosing somebody else). Plot-threads are woven here without any verve, and the points Verbinski attempts to make about the bitterness we're made to feel in an unfeeling society backfire. It's a sleek, handsome piece of work, but dead (both subjectively and intrinsically) at its core. *1/2 from **** \n",

      " From seeing the previews I thought it was going to be an OK film, I was mistaken. First off, the product placement was awful \"I got hit with a milkshake from wendy's\" it's just tasteless. And the whole divorce thing, how many times does a film maker have to make a film about a failing divorce? The characters were very one dimensional and undeveloped. The cinematography was a joke. There was maby one shot in the whole movie with OK compositions, but over all the shot's were just careless especially the two shots. I felt like I was about to fall asleep, half of the people in the theater walked out and I would have too if my friend wasn't the ride home. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! \n",

      " \"The Weather Man\" stars Nicholas Cage as, you guessed it, a TV weather man for a Chicago news station, whose life is both a success and a failure. Just when he thinks he has it all figured out, it all comes back to bite him in the ass.Cage is Dave Spritz, who learns that he is in line for a shot at being a TV weather man for a national TV morning new show, just as his life is coming apart at the seams. He has a strained relationship with his ex Noreen (Hope Davis) and an even more strained relationship with his two teenage children Shelly and Mike(Gemmenne de la Pena, Nicholas Hoult). To add further insult to injury, he learns that his father Robert(Michael Caine), a Pulitzer Prize winning author and national literary figure, has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Then there is also the occasions where he is primary target for people who want to throw fast food out of their car door. When he is offered the audition for this national morning show, he tries to re-connect with his estranged family. He soon learns the errors of his past ways when he can't find any common ground with either of his children. He does however finds solace on an archery range after failing to get Shelly interested in the activity.You watch this movie through the eyes of Dave Spritz. (Cage narrates throughout it) An interesting perspective of this Comedy-Drama. It has it's dramatic moments such as Dave giving a physical beat-down to Mike's guidance counselor Don(Gil Bellows) when he learns that Don attempted sexual advances on Mike. There are the comical moments such as Dave cursing out Noreen's soon-to-be new husband Russ(Michael Rispoli) for no reason whatsoever, even when Russ is trying to be nice. Through and through, I found myself sitting through the movie both laughing and shaking my head at Dave's errors. It definitely kept my interest. TV weathermen throughout the country have proclaimed no connection with Cage's character, which is fine because director Gore Verbinski wasn't trying to tell the story of the average TV weatherman. He is telling the story of a man while successful professionally, his personal life is a train wreck.Solid acting performances all around. However, there is one character that could've been different. That one is Robert Spritzel played by Michael Caine. While I have nothing but the utmost respect for Caine's work, I found his attempt at a Chicago-style accent comes up short. I love his eloquent English accent, which his character should've been English. Regardless of that, this movie is definitely worth a look. \n",

      " Being a Nicolas Cage fan means you have to take the good with the bad, your \"Adaptation.\" with you \"Amos & Andrew, your \"Leaving Las Vegas\" with your \"Snake Eyes\". It means your \"Mathstick Men\" with your \"Weather Man\". But god bless the guy to even be so magnetic and such a great actor that he's the brightest thing (not exactly true as Michael Caine is great as well, but that's pretty much a given) about such a shoddy, half-baked, film about a weatherman forced to decide where his loyalties lie: With his personal or professional life. This is a very slow and internally monologued film, which is of itself, doesn't automatically translate into a bad film, because much of said dialog feels honest. However the fact of the matter is it plays out like barely warmed over second-rate \"American Beauty\" of \"Life as A House\". Now undoubtedly these niche films do have an audience, but they all have one common fatal flaw that some may choose to overlook in lieu of 'the Big Picture', and that flaw is with the cracker-jack \"heartfelt\" cheapened sentimentality, or rather lack there of. That being said this does feel a bit more honest than either of those two previously mentioned films. And I fully expect to get some negative feedback purely out of vendetta against me for scoring this picture low (which is the basic flaw in that IMDb system), but I have to speak my mind and perhaps convince someone to save their hard earned money for something more worthwhile. Is this film rental worthy? Perhaps if you're in the depressed and narcissistic vain mode that most of the characters in the movie are. Is it one to see in the theater? Absolutely not.My Grade: C \n",

      " I watched this and I was disappointed. I expected something more from a movie starring Nicolas Cage (weather man). This movie doesn't have much comedy in it (like The Family Man does), neither is it a good drama (like Bringing Out the Dead, City of Angels, Snake Eyes, Leaving Las Vegas). Nicolas Cage is probably still performing well, but unsophisticated plot (or lack of it) doesn't leave him many chances to affect the viewer, meaning it does not put him in any kind of situations that would make you really laugh or really feel for his character. I guess if not the R rating, this would be a family movie. Apart from that I have enjoyed exceptional work of Michael Caine who plays the weather man's father. \n",

      " This was directed by Gore Verbinski who had just directed The Pirates Of The Caribbean and stars Nicolas Cage who just starred in Lord Of War. Cage is a weather man in Chicago who is separated from his wife, played by Hope Davis, and his two kids don't like being with him very much. His father, played by Michael Caine, is a best selling author who doesn't think Cage has done much with his wife. Cage would like to get back together with Davis but she's seeing another guy and Cage isn't very happy about that. Cage then gets another offer in New York in which he would make a million a year. It's a great movie that was delayed from March so it would have a better chance at the Oscars. \n",

      " Today was the day when I finally watched this movie. I think it was great. Firstly, it's a great acting from Nicholas Cage, who shows again that he is a good actor, in any situation! Well.. the situations in this movie are tense sometimes, but there are funny moments too, when you can laugh. He's the Weather Man and people sometimes throw things to him, because they don't like his show. But he's a great man outside the TV, he's a poor father, but he tries! It's hard with the kids, but he's trying to do his best, to keep the family together, but his wife loves another guy.. Complicated. Well, I just want to say, that this movie has something to say. It has a messege, and this is very important! Nowadays movies are boring, they don't have anything to say, you watch them, you say that they are cool, or maybe not, and tomorrow you forgot them. Well, this movie is special. It show how America is today, what's the way they are heading. The wrong way.. Fast foods, fat kids, assholes, sad families, problems, depression, fat kids again, unhappy people.. It's not just about a Weather man, it's about a society, the American society, the American Dream. You should watch this movie and think about it. That's what America is all about? That's the future? Look around and you will see!.... \n",

      " As a big fan of both Nick Cage and Michael Caine, I almost feel bad for them after watching this movie. This is a thin script punctuated with moments both seemingly uncomfortable just to keep you awake and then surprisingly introspective. Cage plays an almost cartoonishly out of his element Chicago weatherman whose life is a jumble of confusing and uncomfortable bumbling moments. Caine plays his disappointed, almost otherworldly successful father who is constantly stressing Cage's shortcomings while dealing/not dealing with his own personal crisis. It seems as though they made this movie in reverse. Put a cast together for an idea then write a disjointed and unfulfilling story that has a few moments of connection. (Not nearly enough to justify making this movie, though.) I gave it four out of ten only because the screen presence of Cage and Caine kept me interested enough to finish watching. \n",

      " Imagine watching a weather report for 1 and a half hours - well if you can't (but would like to) this is the movie for you. Our leading man (Nicholas Cage) is a troubled father, son, husband, and budding archery pro who cannot seem to get his life together no matter how he tries.Generic marital fights, standard troubled (and overweight) children issues, terminally ill father, and the strong, but silent (and probably alcoholic) mother, all plague our leading weather man. Oh, and by the way, Chicago seems to hate him as much as his ex-wife's new fiancé given the seemingly random, but frequent, public food attacks.\"It's wind, it's wind, it blows all over the place - what the F&*K!\" is about as meaningful a quote as any in the movie.Depressing, moody, artfully enigmatic, but, well, lacking.

      " In a day and age where it seems all of us have found something in life to feel depressed about, here comes another movie designed for those of us who think they should talk to their doctor about the latest depression medication. The Weatherman takes a look at life from what can only be described as a dim point of view, and the plot is vaguely reminiscent of 1999's American Beauty, only without any real message or emotion in its thinly written plot. But to be fair, the acting is superb, and the camera work is more than up to par. However, I truly find myself asking, \"Why did they make this movie\" It offers the viewer nothing new, a little death here, some sharp remarks about life, and a little family drama thrown in for good measure. One could argue that it was written to let us all know that everyone has gone through tough times in their life, but sadly I can think of 10 other movies that have done the same thing for us in the last 5 years. Sadly, this movie will turn a profit based solely on Hollywood's ability to con 5 star actors into movies that could have been written in a fast food restaurant. If your looking for a touching story with excellent acting, a well written plot, and real meaning, Go rent Forrest Gump. \n",

If you have difficulty empathising with others, then you should watch The Weather Man. Nicholas Cage does a superb job of transmitting an idea which haunts a lot of people which is losing our what is most dear to us. On the other hand, Michael Caine portrays the image of a wise, and cunning father who embraces life exactly as it is.This movie captures the irony of life at its best. If you didn't enjoy watching The Weather Man, then I recommend you reconsider your own life, for probably you are unhappy enough that you can't see the light at the end of your pitiful life.Finally, I would like to add that this feature contains some interesting quotes which all of us should heed to as we pursue personal peace. \n",

I find it hard to believe that a director as great as Gore Verbinski would even put his name on a pile of crap like \"The Weather Man.\" I had more enjoyment sitting through \"The Spongebob Movie.\" Ironically Spongebob was the most enjoyable part of \"The Weather Man.\" If you are one who likes dry films that are more about the writers goal of creating a masterpiece then making a film that is enjoyable to sit through, then by all means see this film. However myself and the 20 or so people around me in the theater would gladly tell you that isn't our idea of a good film.

      " Frosty crust and cold tones from the beginning give you a refreshing welcome that steadily warms up with every step into the story. From the title I couldn't figure out what I was going to see and the risk of watching was justified over and above.For sure it is a movie with Nicolas Cage, so you expect some out of the box performance and eruptions of the wildest emotions. For the most part it is calm and charming with a taste of unknown venture for understanding and trying to fix a messed up life but from time to time you get exactly the thing for which master of freak-outs is famous; love the metaphor of the weather man speculating on the future that cannot tell when his life is surrounded with dark stormy clouds.Together with Nicolas Cage we have an amazing Michael Caine who for me is eye-wetting drama actor and steals the limelight every time he is on the screen. Among all the family members struggling through the hard times Gemmenne de la Pena impressed me with an apathic but optimistic performance, which made me wondering why her career hasn't jumpstarted after the movie.Ending the report, I would like to say that the story is actually deeper than seemed in the beginning. Gore Verbinski managed to create a story of a life-fixing growth that shows the need for a positive attitude. Definitely recommend checking it out because in the end every color around will be brighter. \n",

      " 31 October 2005. Underlying this penetrating movie is the slowly evolving sense of self of an everyman buffeted by life and its reality as he waits for the results of a job application he submitted to a national morning news show to be a weatherman. He will experience the collision of his hopes and dreams with an on-going struggle to reconcile with his former wife who has a new man in her life, his daughter who is heavy set and leads a much more unhappy and cruel life than he realizes, his son who is befriended by a male school counselor, his father who is an award-winning author that he can't seem to emulate and who has is also undergoing a life-altering experience (played by Michael Caine), and even his own occupation as a local television weather reporter who gets fast food thrown at him, something that's convenient and non-nutritious. The movie starts with a photographic scene of broken ice sheets, floating up and down, crashing softly upon each other out from a waterfront of where David Spritz played by Nicolas Cage lives and works, as if reflecting Spritz's own broken, loose life. The melodic music captures perfectly the subdued, cloudy, moody, yet strangely beautiful nature of the emotional atmosphere of Cage's life who is somehow living dissociated from his nature, clueless as to the real world around him or the lives, feelings and thoughts of his family members.What makes this movie special is its depiction of everyman, the difficulties of real life and the hard effort it takes to push through it, something that his father attempts to impress upon him. Unlike Christian Slater who faces a traumatic emotional event that sends him spiraling downward in the fascinating and compelling psychological thriller in He Was a Quiet Man (2007) or Leo DeCaprio who plays the bigger than life but secretive rich man in the extravaganza, relational epic of The Great Gatsby (2013), of the culturally foreign colored romantic drama epic of Slumdog Millionaire (2008) that focuses on the un-American cruelty of law enforcement and game shows, or Viggo Mortensen as a family man with a secret past that results in a violent family drama in A History of Violence (2005), or even Mickey Rourke's raw redemptive movie in The Wrestler (2008), The Weather Man interestingly enough is harder to direct and screenplay because it deals with the everyday turmoil of ordinary life struggles of broken marriages, of estranged and detached parents, the emotional struggles of simply living, living up to one's parents expectation and perceived stature, and questioning one's own existence as a person, working in a job that seems relentless empty and cruel.In some ways The Weather Man captures the same sense of a living ambiance of life as in the period family drama of an oldest sister attempting to take care of her family after their father dies in the obscure Appalachian film Where the Lilies Bloom (1974). The Weather Movie echoes of Michael Douglas playing a man's evolving descent into self-destruction in Falling Down (1993) or Edmond (2005) a much darker human drama, yet has a more lofty and quaint voice-over narrative by Nicholas Cage that resonate at times with our own thoughts and feelings at one time or another. Just as effective family dramas such as the classic Days of Wine and Roses (1962) dealing with alcoholism, that has Nicole Kidman playing a rather eccentric mother in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or even the rich family period drama of The Tree of Life (2011), The Weather Man somehow captures a visceral immersion into emotional insights selecting well directed scenes of everyday drama edited together in a richly flowing storyline, doing so without the more edgy, independent cinematography offering a more serious but enjoyable film experience as found in the romantic comedy of Under the Tuscan Sun (2003) or If Only (2004) starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nicholls whose lives are reflected more than once in this fantasy, comedy, drama with even more startling dramatic results. Even with the well received family drama, American Beauty (2000), or the more chilling award-winning The Ice Storm (1997), The Weather Man comes across just as qualitatively solid but without the glossy photo finish of a professional execution of both movies that in some ways offers the audience a more direct connection and involvement with The Weather Man.The Weather Man can be more likened to Silver Lining Playbook (2012) but more focused on a father instead of a mutual adult relationship and without the need for as much eccentric dialogue and outlandish plot points to portray the same satisfying emotive and intellectually revealing results. Similar to Elizabethtown (2005) involving death, there is a playful undertone throughout or Lost in Translation (2003) with more detailed substantive, dramatic themes, dealing as well similarly with its material as sincerely and honestly with its subject matter. The Weather Man is some ways is a modern update of Buddha's own search for enlightenment but in an American style. \n",

      " A Chicago TV weather man who is not a meteorologist and who is looking for some meaning to his bleak life is the subject of THE WEATHER MAN, with a mo-haired Nic Cage in the lead. His work pays well but has no meaning, he cannot seem to stop fighting with his ex-wife, his relationship with his two children is strained, and wherever he goes, he finds himself pelted with soft drinks and worse by disgruntled viewers. Cage is perfectly morose. The lovely Hope Davis is his tormented wife. Michael Caine is his ailing father. Sounds like the perfect cast. But the movie is a study in despair, and not intended for mainstream audiences. It is an art-house job that was marketed as a cineplex flick, and audiences predictably stayed away in droves. I cannot recommend THE WEATHER MAN other than to see Cage at work. And tenderhearts, beware: The film is laced with four-letter words. And I do mean laced. Troweled actually. \n",

      " This movie made me cry which I haven't done in a while. The Weatherman summarizes the pain of divorce, loss of a loved one, empty career, and life after divorce. Nicholas Cage climbed into my head to display, on screen, the emptiness I feel within. Michael Caine was the perfect absent father figure returned to attempt to reverse his damage. The demise of his physical health through the movie was portrayed very well, the perfect mix of subtle and extreme. I am happy I stumbled upon this movie; it makes me feel there are other people within society who feel as sad as I do. Hopefully this movie has convinced someone to stay married. \n",

      " should be the concept of the Weatherman's (David Spritz) life. His life is a gloomy forecast. His kids, ex-wife, and award winning father have a generally dislike for him. He has people treating him like trash in the street because they see him as phony or a joke on TV. Spritz gets food and drinks thrown on him several times. He tries to spend more time with his daughter by coming up with activities like archery, but his daughter doesn't like to follow through. She is unhappy because her parents are divorced and she is overweight and gets laughed at in school.David gets a job offer for the network morning show. At first, he just ignores the calls because he seems depressed. It is a bigger paycheck and what he has worked for in TV since being a weather forecaster, but returning a call is too difficult of chore for him. Does David get his dream job and become a better parent toward his kids? Those questions are answered at the end. But, for me, this movie was a little on the long side and some boring parts. Plus, it's plain depressing.FINAL VERDICT: It's not a comedy as one might think. It's OK, but not good enough for me to recommend. It needs to be more entertaining. \n",

      " Dave Spritz is a weatherman from Chicago, who is separated from his wife and kids. his father is dying and his ex-wife hates him. In an effort to be a good father he tries to bond with his daughter, but ends up making things worse.When Gore Verbinski is not directing Johnny Depp on the high seas, he's giving us some underrated films should get more respect then have. The Ring was a remake that scared it's American audience and Mousehunt is a surprisingly funny film. This time around he does it again with The Weatherman. A dark comedy that scores when it's subtle. Verbinski's eye for the blue overtone throughout the film adds to it's cold and depressing feeling. If it weren't for it's comedy scattered throughout the film, it would feel like another Leaving Las Vegas. Where it's character is on the down spiral to the bottom of the pit.Cage plays Spritz, a man who you either like or dislike. Some people hate him for his fake name and his face, others for the fact that he's a weatherman. The audience are the only people who are let into this characters life. Spritz seems like a lovable guy on the camera, but behind it his life is falling apart. Whether you like the characters actions or not, you have to give it up to Cage, he makes the character himself likable. As he did with his performance in \"Lord of War\", Cage takes a character with many faults and whom some people find down right despicable and gives him a heart and connects with the audience. You know he's screwed up his life and has destroyed his family, yet he is also trying to be a good father. Even when he fail at doing that, seeing him try and be a good man changes your perspective of who he is.There is no real plot to write about, but the film itself is a story of this man's life and his attempt to rebuild what he had destroyed. I none scene we see why he thinks he lost his family, he forgot the tartar sauce. In what is one of the most funny scenes in the film, it serves as the key point as to why he is the way he is. He never listen to his wife, as she put it. But what we see is that he does, but he doesn't care enough to remember. He would rather think about other women, the man who flew across the world in 80 days and how cold it is outside.Caine has a small role as Cage's father, while he is not memorable or does anything to stand out, he serves as yet another reason why Spritz is the way he is. He's living in his father's shadow. This is a man who is respected by everyone and has won prizes for his writing left right and centre. Hope Davis who plays the wife and again does nothing memorable either, but play it straight as the women who has no affection for her ex-husband anymore. Out of everyone in the film, the daughter would be the most boring and annoying. I've never really been a fan of child actors though anyway.The pacing is slow and builds up to nothing, but you know that nothing is going to happen. You are simply suppose to see this man and his life. Everything that happens to him is in a negative way. The one good thing that does happen to him means a bad thing for something else. I don't want to give anything away, but the film plays out exactly as life does. Not everything goes in our favour and we must learn to accept that.The film is indeed depressing at times, but the comedy lifts that up to the point where you don't really notice it. Seeing Cage being hit with every fast food product you can think of is entertaining, as well as when he slaps a man in the face with his glove as if he were from the 15th century. The comedy is subtle and it works here. If it were laugh out loud funny or sight gags it would have really hurt the film. But having Cage be hit with a drink then calmly saying he was hit by a Big Gulp is comic genius.The Weatherman isn't a film for everyone. It was marketed as something it wasn't. For those who are able to appreciate the film for what it's trying to do, you will be satisfied. For those looking for a feel good movie, you'll be vastly disappointed. The film contains many unneeded swear words, but that can be overlooked. If I had to choose between a weatherman whose life is falling apart, or a film about Pirates and a Dead Man's Chest, I'll gladly choose The Weatherman. \n",

      " \"The Weather Man\" is not quite the comedy one would expect it to be. In fact the movie is quite blunt and depressing. Regardless in the end this film is brilliant and is not afraid to deliver a movie that does not follow the typical happy Hollywood story.David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is the Chicago weather man who is trying to turn his life into the perfect dream that he has for it. Unfortunately the more he tries to make things better the worse they become. He also has the comedic problem of getting fast food items randomly thrown at him.His wife (Hope Davis) has divorced him and is dating another man, his daughter is becoming over weight thus being teased at school, his son uses drugs, and his father (Michael Caine) is recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. See what I mean by depressing.David then comes up with a slightly flawed plan to try and resolve these problems and bring his family back together. This entails them all moving to New York where he will become a weather man on a national morning news program and things will magically work themselves out. As hard as David tries to make this happen we know that it will never happen. The reason for this is David is an extremely flawed character. He is lazy, vulgar, and mostly immature. Also he does not even know who he is as a person, so how is he able to repair his family if he cannot repair himself. He also feels as if he has to live up to the high expectations of his father who is highly respected and award winning author. From here David attempts to find out who he is with the help of his dying father and his recently acquired hobby of archery. Both of these aids in his journey of self discovery as he tries to put his life back together. The director Gore Verbinski strays from the genre of his previous works including \"The Ring\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and its sequels to do a simplistic drama. He does a masterful job in showing the story of this conflicted man. Although he can be quite despicable at times the viewer still cares for him.\"The Weather Man\" is also a very blunt movie. It always attempts to resemble reality throughout the script. This includes plenty of cussing and sexual dialogue. The language might deter some from the film, but ultimately gives it a gritty feeling that seems true to real life conversations. . The film also purposefully strays from the perfect and sappy resolutions popular in most movies because things in life rarely happen that way. The film was recently released on DVD. The special features include a theatrical trailer and five features about different aspects of the film such as the script, the style, and the characters. These features are very well done and intriguing to watch. Many of them provide insightful views about the themes and characters in the film. \"The Weather Man\" may not appeal to all viewers because of its gloomy nature, but the film delivers a great story that does have some humor and poignant moments. \n",

      " Well...What can I say, I've only seen a few Nicolas Cage movies and didn't know what to expect. I actually really enjoyed this one though, I think Nicolas Cage did a really good job. They were able to make a movie about real-life occurrences and make it both heartfelt and entertaining. I had never really heard much about this movie until the other day. My friend and I were discussing the movie \"Ghost Rider\" and she called Nicolas Cage a terrible actor saying he was washed up. I asked for proof of this and her reply was \"Have You SEEN The Weather Man\"? of course I couldn't argue back not having seen the film, however, I will now be able to report back that i have indeed seen it and actually rather enjoyed it. for anyone who hasn't seen this film i highly suggest you check it out.. you will not be disappointed :) \n",

      " Well cast, well acted, well directed, and well produced. Also a very unusual movie in that its plot doesn't follow a traditional arc, but moves along a route that adult viewers will understand as typical of civilian life in our day and age. It reminded me very much of Philip Roth's \"Sabbath's Theater,\" especially in the way it truthfully followed the successes--but much more numerous defeats--of its male protagonist. Cage does an excellent job, as does the rest of the cast, though I wish that Michael Caine had been granted a bit more voltage--as a Pulitzer Prize winning writer, he's neither as articulate as he might be, nor as insightful.Watch this movie. \n",

      " Gore Verbinsky has a short but interesting career(well,interesting if we forget The Mexican)and he experimented with different genres and styles,something I find great.He showed he is efficient to transform a script into a movie but without his own vision or dramatic identity.The weather man is my favorite movie directed by him and it's the first time I saw his vision inside a movie.The best thing about this movie is that I could identify with the main character.I think The weather man can be categorized as a drama,but it's more than that.The movie is far away of the cheap sentimentalism and the movie shows a man with good intentions but bad decisions and the movie shows the cruel humor that the situation can bring,so I say The weather man is more a tragic comedy than a drama.Another good point this movie has is that it does not have the typical happy ending this kind of movie has.Nicolas Cage has a great performance,the great Michael Caine has a brilliant performance and his change of expressions are simply great,Hope Davis also brings a solid performance and Gemmenne de la Peña has an impressing performance.I hope to see this young actress on more movies.This is a complex and deep movie and I like a lot this kind of movies.Rating:8.5 \n",

      " This was how the movie was described to me, but I found it to be far more than that.It is a dark story of family relationships focusing on Cages' character as a TV weatherman. He plays the role in a far more understated performance than that we normally get from him and the film is all the better for it.Michael Caine plays his father in an equally understated (and good) performance.Like American Beauty I found the film to be a great watch, but still profoundly depressing. For all of the consumer luxuries we enjoy in the west and all the comfort we enjoy from our pampered lifestyles the film shows what a void many of us live in emotionally.It's not that type of film, so I'm sure there won't be a sequel but I for one would love to know \"what happened next\". \n",

      " David Spritz is a Chicago TV weatherman whose life has become as imprecise and unpredictable as the forecasts he delivers to the waiting and often highly skeptical masses (he is quick to point out that he is no certified meteorologist). And if his life could be summed up in one of those forecasts, it would be, \"Mostly cloudy with a chance of heavy showers.\"When he was younger, Dave had visions of how his life would turn out, but somehow those visions never managed to materialize. A failure as both a husband and a father, he is currently divorced from his ex-wife, Noreen, and has a teenage son in rehab and an overweight daughter with a poor self image both of whom Dave is trying desperately to make a connection with. He also has an overly critical father (Michael Caine) who has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a weather forecaster, Dave also has to suffer the recurrent indignity of being a second tier \"celebrity,\" which manifests itself in total strangers throwing fast food products at him whenever he is out walking the streets - an obvious metaphor for his life.Written by Steve Conrad and directed by Gore Verbinski, \"The Weather Man\" is not for all tastes and audiences, but those with an appreciation for subtle black humor may find themselves drawn to its themes. It provides a subdued portrait of a man who seems unable to take control of the elements of his life and, thus, finds his world splintering apart in many different directions. Part of the problem comes from the feeling of inadequacy instilled in him by his father, an inadequacy that prevents Dave from assuming the responsibilities that an adult must in order to fulfill his role as a productive member of society. For Dave is the first to admit that his job is a mere sinecure and that he's made a genuine mess of his marriage and family life through his lack of focus and tendency towards fear and inaction. The sullen mood, reflected in the stark wintry chill of the Chicago setting, lends a gravity to the film's wry, offbeat humor.Although we've seen Cage in this sad sack, victim-of-circumstances role before, he does a nice job here making Dave empathetic without turning him into a sap. There are fine turns too from Hope Davis as Noreen, Gemmenne de la Pena as his daughter, Nicholas Hoult (the \"boy\" in \"About a Boy\") as his son and Caine as the father who can still make David's self image wither under his pointed but ever-so-subtle criticism. The movie doesn't go in for grand speechifying or neatly tied-up resolutions, preferring instead to see life for the absurdly unpredictable and jumbled mess it truly is.The one genuinely sour note in the film is struck by the presence of a rehab counselor who attempts to seduce Dave's 15-year-old son into having sex with him. The filmmakers should not be feeding the odious stereotype of gay men as dangerous sexual predators. It is unworthy of the filmmakers and of their movie - and it leaves a sour aftertaste. \n",

He's separated/divorced from his wife and not paying enough attention to his children. What seems to be an attempt to make the situation surreal just makes the characters seem cardboard. Problems are developed as if they're paint-by-numbers and resolved the same way.Even Michael Cain, someone I love to watch, is sub-par here. I blame it on the material.A slow paced movie must have enough to think about to keep interest. This almost does, but not quite. It's not a bad movie, it's just not a good one.

      " Who is Gore Verbinski? I mean seriously, what kind of director is he, doing this film with art pretensions between two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' sequels? I confess that while I love good serious cinema I prefer in this case by far the Verbinski of the Pirates.'The Weather Man' shows what happens when big American studios try to make a 'serious' movie, while keeping the theme within the narrow borders of the anti-septic mid-upper class America. Nicholas Cage, good as ever but not better in this movie plays a successful weather man, who succeeds beyond everybody's expectations in his career, but is a complete failure in his personal life. One wonders how this almost incapacitated man can succeed in TV, and we are really kept wondering for the duration of the movie and after. Nothing interesting really happens in this film, and it would be a complete failure without the absolutely amazing supporting role of Michael Caine. I wish this great actors will be a long time with us and will get many opportunities for great roles like this. Otherwise there is no reason to see this film. \n",

The movie heavy handedly hammers home the theme: life is like the weather, unpredictable and random and like the wind, just blows around. We are all weathermen. Gee, that's deep. All the while, we watch Cage wander about in a state of confusion, Michael Caine dispensing vacuous advice, he shrew ex-wife castrating him at every opportunity and his screwed up kids whine. Whining is big in this movie, since Cage does his share too.This movie is supposed to be about the characters since there is no discernible plot. Well what about the characters?

Not that he had no problems, he had quite a few, but we all got problems. i just didn't know why he was getting so over worked up at times. i guess that is what a fast food world could do to you if you are not careful. I hate how in America it seems that a high percentage of family problems/crises seem to start from the most banal issues of who is going to take the garbage out, in this case his tartar sauce ordeal with his wife. I liked and hoped with expectation for the ending we get in this film, his sense of acceptance.

      " Dave Spritz is a Chicago weather man whose life is more or less in shambles. His wife has left him for another man, his father is sick, he doesn't see his kids as much as he wants to, and his job is boring though it pays well. Dave decides to leave his passive self behind act on life to finally make something more of himself that his family will be proud of.Not too often do you get a big star and a director fresh off of a huge blockbuster action movie to deliver such a warm and honest drama. It is really nothing like Nicolas Cage has done since he become a big name in Hollywood and it is surely nothing like Gore Verbinski has ever done. Yet it all plays out well with insights into family, life, and how people are perceived on the surface and, most importantly, that that is often not who they really are. One of the film's very first scenes, in a DMV line, is a prime example. What might have turned people off is that many of these scene get very negative and it is not in a goofy way. Dave Spritz isn't a sitcom loser, he is just a loser. He can't be honest to his wife, he is somewhat of a loner, and in general not a very interesting person. But what matters, is that it is all honest. No gloss, no cheese, just a true portrait of a character in his problematic world.The film also suffered from stupid ads which gave people the idea of a slapstick sitcom-like movie. WRONG. Oh so very wrong. There are quirky moments and even very funny moments, but it is because life has funny moments. They aren't forced, there are not just for some comic relief after a dramatic moment, they are honest bits of life. That essentially makes this sort of an independent film with studio and star backing. Mainly thanks to Steve Conrad who doesn't not seem like a big studio screenwriter, but also thanks to Nicolas Cage and Gore Verbinski for using their status to get such a nice surprise be made. 8/10Rated R for profanity and mature themes \n",

      " I thought this was great, it started to get very negative like cage was giving up and nearly started to annoy as he, for a couple of scenes straight, was made maybe too clear that his life was in the s**t. It didn't over step the mark though and it gave a great natural balance of what life is really like when things get tough, like when it seems all news is bad, there is some light, like his new job, even though his home life seemed to pull him down. I think the part where it all came to ahead with his bow pointed at the fat guy his ex was going to marry was fantastic, one more bad thought and he could've let go, it seemed that close. All the relationship between father and son, on both accounts was very emotional and fitting for the up bringing of both cage and his son. Well shot film too, loved the archery parts with the ice on the targets and the ice on the water. Solid film, a very honest script not afraid to bare raw emotion. \n",

The movie follows the life of weather man David Spritz, who is a very good weather man but not a good husband. With the extra pressure of living up to his father (Michael Caine)who was a very successful book writer in his time. While trying to sort out his wavering life, and succeed in a descent weather job, David learns of his father terminal illness and sets off on a mission to make all good in his family.Brilliant performances from Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine a good film to watch if you like dramas \n",

      " What a film, its so pleasing to see nicolas cage back in his suited role as a desperate middle aged man. Reminiscent of his earlier works i.e adaptation and bringing out the dead. If you don't like subtle humour, general comments on the poorness of life and deliberated voice-overs then you'll probably run to the kitchen to make a sandwich after ten minutes of watching.Micheal Cane put in a great performance as Dave Spritz' father with a real reason to be thinking bleakly about life. While Spritz himself has a great career his lacking family life and incessant pelting from fast food makes him express himself in such ways as taking up archery. The ironically used product placement shows us the throwaway fast food lifestyle we lead without really caring about anything.it's quite a slow film with some funny moments and you'll either find it poetic or boring, if you like action and high paced movies it's probably not worth your time. \n",

      " Gore Vebrinski directs this story of weatherman Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage), whose life is spinning out of control. With his wife, Noreen (Hope Davis), seeing another man who happens to be a jerk and his father (Michael Caine) dying from lymphoma. His young daughter is smoking cigarettes and his teenage son is in rehab. And in the midst of all the pandemonium, Spritz begins to fall apart.Yes, this movie is depressing. I couldn't help but feel sad watching this movie because you felt bad for Dave, but then you found out why his life was so screwed up. And it was ultimately his fault. Having sex with other women and not paying attention to the wife and kids can hurt a family relationship.When the movie ended, I turned to my dad and asked what he thought. He replied that he thought it was dull and stupid. I must agree that some parts of the movie did seem to drag, but in the end, this tale of breakdown, grief, and struggle is ultimately brilliant. Great performances from Cage and Caine especially. I'm surprised one of them wasn't up for an Oscar.9/10 \n",

      " Wow. A friend of mine had told me that this was one of the worst films he had ever seen. He went on to say it only had a few funny moments when Cage was hit with stuff. As per usual, I took this certain friends poor review to mean that I would probably like it. I wasn't expecting a comedy, but something a bit less existential. I had actually seen little more than a trailer a long time ago, so I was actually expecting something a bit more resembling the movie Falling Down. I expected to see Cage losing it over so many people complaining about his mis-predicted weather that he went ballistic on a town with a bow and arrow.Boy am I glad that I was wrong. I was going to take it with a grain of salt. But, once the film ended, the deep, rich story line had me turned in a few different directions. Do you feel for the main character? Do you feel angry at him? Is it his father's fault? The movie does such a wonderful job teetering around many possibilities as well as including the risk factor of several possible life altering experiences. Several of the bad ones seem to overshadow the good experiences, but upon further musing at the end of the movie, you start to realize where the hidden moments of good opportunity existed. Did he make the right choices? Did he say the right thing? I am also a big proponent or worthwhile resolve. Movies that leave you hanging (NOT in the sense that there will be a sequel) are usually poorly put together. Granted, you give someone like Lynch an open ended idea, and he will masterfully complete a film with a perfect ending that leaves everyone thinking, 'What the hell just happened?'. This film satisfied me while not being ultimate. By the middle towards the end of the movie, there were a few possibilities for where it could all end up. It's final destination was worthy and explained decently enough for acceptance.The most amazing thing about this film was the depth of each character based on how flat they were all acted. The flatness I describe is clearly intended. So little emotion is shown at many points that you wonder if these people are all on Valium. It becomes apparent that they're all just numb to their surrounding due to their current circumstances. It's almost as if the more emotion a character shows, the more in touch they are at the present time.This also produces ideal capabilities for those that are the more flat of the bunch to be able to wear the emotions they DO decide to show right on their sleeve for the whole world to see.This movie was brilliantly written, directed, and performed. If you're into movie that make you think and take some concentration to follow, it's a must see. If you're like my friend, however, go rent How To Lose a Girl in 10 Days, again. \n",

      " The trailer of the movie greatly emphasize the comedy part of the film.It felt a bit like American Beauty 2 when i saw it on the net. Yet The Weatherman deals the problems in an entire different approach. It has it's ambiguous details and notes but overall it's a pretty good dramathat reflects what life is like for a man after 40. Nick Cage plays the weather man in a midlife crisis. Everything around him is falling apart and it doesn't get better in anyway. He dreamed of landing a new job on \"Hello America\" as their new weather man which he thought would be able to bring everything back together. The movie focused a lot on Nick's character's relationship with the people around him. He wanted to press restart or at least rewind to where things were but is effortless. A lot of things are changing and getting out of hand that he simply lost his past values of how life should be. What really caught my eyes was how real these problems can be, they're not completely disastrous like American Beauty where a little bit of imagination is still needed in order for the story to revolve. These are problems we face everyday and we sometimes forget how lethal and deadly they can still be. And it was with great details they use to tell the story that reminds us how dramatic our simple normal life is. The acting is superb. Each character bounce off each other real well. Most memorable scenes should be the scenes between Cage and Caine. We see two man beaten up by life at two different stages exchanging thoughts and suggestions. And Ithink if it wasn't for Caine's last couple of words on the car this movie would've lost focus completely. That was one of the problems with the movie. It was really good at reflecting but no clear resolutions. And it would confuse the audience because as viewers, we don't accept the facts and the changes as fast. It would look like Cage's character has gone off in a better place at the end but it would be quite an amiguous mark to leave the audience at the end of the thread. Maybe that's all it wants to express. Hey! Weather changes, deal with it! \n",

      " This is a strange film but considering that everybody all over the world might undergo an emotional and spiritual crisis it will be interesting to see Nicholas Cage (actor belonging to the category of \"great stars\") playing a success man during his post mid-life crisis. Francis Ford Coppola's nephew had already played this role - I remember \"Matchstick Man\" and \"The Family man\" and also this time succeeds in acting very convincingly. He's superb in rendering David's confusion and describing this really engrossing character who makes us smile with his anxieties. Gore Verbinski (The curse of the black pearl, Pirates of the Caribbean) is also a guarantee. \n",

      " It seems that almost all the comments on this film have been the same, that it has been mis-sold by the trailer, advertising and packaging, as a comedy. O.K. they may have misleadingly coaxed in some punters who wanted a comedy but, they risked losing those who wanted a thoughtful human drama. Life itself inevitably includes things which make you gently smile, but that does not mean that all life is a 'quirky comedy'. I have just seen the film and found it, predominantly, depressing, but interesting because it was real. On my particular DVD package, it is described as a \"quirky comedy\". By that I presume they mean a comedy that doesn't make you laugh. A few posters here have found it 'hilarious'. Perhaps the key is empathy. If you see yourself as sufficiently far away from these characters and events, you may find them 'hilarious' but, for many of us, we know just how vulnerable and helpless life can make us feel sometimes because, as the Michael Caine character observes, life isn't easy. \n",

      " I started out disliking this movie and thought it was incredibly boring, but it grew on me as it went along, and by the end I liked it. It sort of flowed along, and felt like watching a play rather than a movie, which worked well in some ways and didn't in others. I really don't think Michael Caine is capable of giving a bad performance, and though Nicholas Cage sometimes bothers me, this movie reminded me that he can act after all.I think what finally made me really appreciate this film is that it defied some stereotypes that I often find annoying. For example, 9 times out of 10, in a movie including divorced parents, the mother is the wonderful caretaker, and the father is a deadbeat. Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds comes to mind as typical of this. But here you see a man who is actually trying very hard, and, in some ways, is a better parent than his ex-wife. And they didn't make a big deal about it, they just gradually revealed that the relationships in general were more complex than one would initially assume. Complexity is good.Unfortunately, the movie was a little too slow at times, and frankly it surprises me that the producers thought it would do well; I can't imagine who the target audience was supposed to be. But then again, I thought movies like Duece Bigalow: Male Gigolo would flop and instead they're successful enough to get sequels. Shows what I know. \n",

      " I suppose people who see this film/DVD will expect something completely different. I know I did, and was pleasantly surprised.Rather than being a throw-away comedy, The Weather Man is a character-driven film that produces laughs by exposing the awkward subtext of its characters. The truth is, this is really not the type of writing and directing you would expect from a big studio film.Nicolas Cage is at his best playing David Spritz, a Chicago weather man who is caught trying to square the reality of his job with the lack of respect he receives in every corner of his life. Spritz's father, Robert (Michael Caine), is an award winning novelist - someone who tries to understand how David can 'predict' weather without having a degree in meteorology. That underlying question is key as David tries to find strength in what should be a notable role as a media personality, father, husband and adult son.The truth is I often find that Cage can being overly caught up in his own off-key and overly inflated importance when it comes to playing damaged characters. Sometimes he gives such characters stupid ticks. His overly acted stares are prone to last two beats too long. But this time, he lets his character have 'flat' moments - some of which are terrible funny in a very tragic way. Cage and Caine have great moments that underscore the best abilities of both actors.The Weather Man is neither a Leaving Las Vegas nor a Honeymoon in Vegas. It's also far from being a mix between these opposites. In fact, Cage is closer to playing the type of character we find in Adaptation. And for that reason, this film is better suited for the type of person who enjoys the surprise of an indie film with the budget of a studio feature. \n",

This film is not anything special story-wise, its everyday stuff, but I like how the director kept it simple and created an atmosphere with this picture that makes it funny, tought provoking and a truly good movie.

He is someone who gets \"a large reward for zero effort and contribution.\" So why is he miserable? Despite his charming TV persona, he is not comfortable with himself. Selfish and self-involved, he is alienated from his ex-wife and their children. He genuinely loves his family and is desperate to connect, but his clueless attempts are inept and sometimes hilarious.The film is beautifully visual, with the monotone Chicago winter weather dominating and mirroring David's personal crisis.

He tries hard to make things better, but could not help his kids nor the situation with his ancient wife.Actually, the weather man is the ordinary man. I bet there are a lot of guys like him around the globe. It is not a beautiful vision of life, but it is realistic, a bit sarcastic, and sometimes fun. Because Gore Verbinski gives a cynical point of view of life, not so desperate, just explicating the rudeness that goes through our lives, even if it is sometimes great (being in front of Spong Bob?), it is most of the time, tough.Michael Caine as the idealistic father, the one who succeed, is remarkable.

He is taunted by doubts about his celebrity, torn between a chance to become a national weather man at a major network in New York and the increased frequency of fast food being tossed at him from driving cars.Spritz is constantly faced with situations where he can prove he is the strong confident man his disapproving father (Caine) would be proud of, only to fail on each occasion. The only time he does act is by slapping his wife's boyfriend with a glove for no apparent reason. The result? \"Here's something that if you want your father to think you're not a silly f**k, don't slap a guy across the face with a glove because if you do that, that's what he will think.\" The movie feels a bit like life. You want it to go somewhere. You want something meaningful to happen. It rarely ever does. Eventually, you have to admit to yourself that you have limitations and accept things the way they are. I find that extremely depressing, because it could well be true. \n",

Bad language in the right place can add to the effect, but in The Weather Man, it seemed to me that the F word was used just for the sake of it. There was a terrible waste of food in this film, too. All the fast food (in more ways than one)being thrown from cars was littering in the extreme. How come the passing car drivers weren't pulled over for littering, or better still, Nicholas Cage's character for depositing litter on the pavement, sorry, sidewalk, because he was the last person to have any contact with said food? I don't mean to be unkind to Nicholas Hoult, but he should have kept his shirt on, although I know this was part of the plot to illustrate his coach's unhealthy interest in the boy. For the girls, this would have been the only real excitement in this film had young Hoult been the possessor of a bod worth looking at. It looks as though he could do with a few bench press and sit up exercises. Someone of his age should show more tendency towards a six-pack rather than that of a bay window tummy. \n",

I am not a big fan of Michael Cane but thought he did a good job too. Both Cane and Cage were able to keep their scenes interesting with the dry humor that was used. Each subplot of the story worked and kept the viewer interested. The story deals with everything from his professional life, his relationship with an ex-wife, and on-going issues with his children.

This movie was funny, and had a great message about spending your time doing things that matter, and dealing with life with vigor even though it sucks. The only thing I was disappointed about was that Cages' character made 250,000 dollars a year. I could have related much more to someone who made closer to 30. I suppose not every movie is intended to relate to every person, but the message was such that it seemed to be talking to the little guy. Perhaps the point was that even though Cage was financially successful, he still felt like the little guy because he felt his job had no meaning. Michael Caine was very good as Cages' father, and I am glad they chose him. I spent much of the movie wondering where I knew his kid Mike from, and realized toward the end that he was the kid in \"About a Boy\". Needless to say he has gotten much older. Loved the soundtrack, and even choked up a bit when Caine played \"Like a Rock\" for Cage in his car. I recommend buying this one. \n",

      " I'm really glad to see that someone are willing to make movies like this. It's a real character driven slice of life about finding yourself and your place in it all. Something I think everybody that has a few decades on their back can relate to. David Spritz (Cage) is struggling with several parts of his life and what he has accomplished. He has a hard time living up to his fathers (Michael Cain) greatness and also have a failed marriage and a rather unyielding job as a local weather man. He is quite inept in all he tries and is basically a shy introvert that just tries his best to be a good father and person in general. He has little or no idea what's going on in his kids life and he still has a hard time accepting that his former wife has moved on while he has not. Untop of this he has to deal with the fact that the rock in his life, his father has a terminal illness. From there we pretty much follow Dave Spritz and his dealing with all these things life keep throwing at him. If your expecting action of any kind your better off watching another movie. This is a story of life and the mundane but important things that matters to oneself and what you might have to endure to get where you want. Nicolas Cage is in almost every frame of this movie so he has quite a big burden to carry but he manages quite well. He portrayal is abit similar to his \"Adaptation\" Kaufman character and it's nice to see him tackle these kinda role as oppose to going the action hero road as many other would do. The rest of the cast also delivers the goods, specially M.Cain. If you don't recognize some of the situations and dilemmas in this movie your probably on your way to relate to them.

      " There is so much I could say about this film, which bored me to tears because I went in expecting a comedy. Were not for this confusion, I might have given it a star higher, but I maintain that while it is a decent film, it is a terrible movie. The advertisements make the film out to be something spectacular, but the film strives to be anything but spectacular. This is a film about real life, real family struggles, no fairy tale parents and children. There is one image introduced throughout the film that could be seen as symbolic for attempting to get one's life \"on target\", which is truly beautiful.In the end, I believe there is one way to know for sure if you'll enjoy this film: If you enjoyed Ozu's Tokyo Monogatari (Tokyo Story), you'll enjoy The Weather Man. Expect a little bit more humor, sometimes resulting in a little less believability, while maintaining the same focus on realism. \n",

      " Well,I have to say that I've read quite a few reviews of this film and have to disagree. A lot of the story to Weatherman is in the pain and frustration of the main character of David Spritz(Nicholas Cage). I truly loved this film,sure it's not on the top of my list,but I will most definitely buy this once it comes out. The imagery in the film is amazing,it's shot very well. I liked this,Spritz is a very realistic character and very down to earth. He's not the normal man of film,just a man trying to get by and having a hard time dealing. It's great,just a bit of a downer. Don't watch it when you're in a happy mood,but it is worth viewing. I suggest it to any man experiencing the difficulties of divorce. Enjoy. \n",

      " I must say I was disappointed in this film in some respects, and rather impressed ion others. I was impressed with the story about Davis Spritz, except the part about him being a weather anchor, I wasn't looking for that. I had a hard time believing that a major TV station would hire someone who came across like Spritz to do TV weather. I didn't think he looked all that good on camera in those scenes. Then again, I'm prejudiced. I spent the last six months anchoring the weather on KZSW TV channel 27 in Hemet, CA. (Then again, then I watch some of my on weather spots, I wonder why I have a job.) My disappointments are not to say that this is a bad film, just not what I was hoping for. The fact that Spritz is a weatherman is incidental to the story. I, naturally, would have preferred to see a story that was more about his life as a weatherman. More of his life in the TV station, than his private life. I would have liked to be able to show the film to friends to show them what it's like to do the weather, but there is too little of that. It is also too offensive for most of my friends.I also agree with others who say the film is \"vulgar.\" I think the \"F-word\" was far overused, and the vulgarity was more than necessary. This would have been a better film if it had been kept to a PG-13 rating. Because of the R rating, I think this film is going to be short-lived at the box-office, will go to DVD earlier than planned, and will have low DVD sales. I doubt that news people will buy it to play at work like we did for \"The Anchorman.\" I must add also, that I never had any of my viewers throw food at me. . .until this film came out. Two nights ago, I had an egg thrown at me in a Wal-mart parking lot. It was a clean miss, but hit a parked car. (Not mine.) I wonder if any other weather anchors have had food thrown at them since this film came out. \n",

      " When thinking about the essence of this movie's message, a thoughtful viewer may curiously find themselves constantly looking for the humor - hopefully to be found somewhere in the 'next' scene. What could seem to be an overzealous use of profanity, narrow-mindedness and mental undergrowth by the main character (Nicolas Cage) as imposed by the script and director, become painfully obvious as traits that have been painstakingly crafted and interwoven into the storyline. Gradually, perceiving the subtle aspects of who the 'weatherman' really is - among his friends family and co-workers challenges the movie goer to finally see the main character's flaws, and ultimately we take a tack that jives with who he sees himself to be. Underlying theme - Life is not always a box of chocolates, and for some, knowing what we are is only a matter of time in gradually coming to grips with who we've always been. In that way, the movie seems to allow each viewer to paint their own story's meaning. Assuredly, this movie steers clear of the standard ninety minute journey that entails a trek among the winds of happy endings, confidently pressing the sails towards the usual well packaged conclusions. What is found instead is an experience of movie going rarity that allows a multidimensional character (and many aspects of his life) to unfold before our eyes only to reveal the expected life experiences that one may possibly endure sometimes do not yield the congruent message of our purposeful existence that many of us often go to the movies to find reassure of. Anyone finding intrigue in deciphering complex human behavior should find this movie very invigorating and especially fulfilling in terms of 'after viewing' conversations. Nicholas Cage does a superb job of adding yet another dimension to his diverse talent roster. \n",

      " That is what this move was sold as, and even here listed as, a comedy. However, this movie is not a comedy in the modern sense of the word. Rather, it follows the path of a traditional theatrical comedy. Meaning; it chronicles a descent through darker events into a valley with a very dark moment, then a certain event causes a quick rise to a happier ending(example: Dante's Divine Comedy). This film does have humorous parts, but it is not comical. The few humorous parts were all seen in the trailers for this film(If you want to laugh watch those and stay out of the theater). The storyline follows a weatherman trying to come to grips with his life after he has screwed it up beyond repair. This movie is a sad story of modern man that is unarguably true in its message; You cannot control everything, and the only way to come to grips with that is to accept it. The movie was well acted and well directed, but the declining action at the beginning of the film was drawn out. It could have easily been a much shorter film with the same story, but it either wasn't written that way or wasn't edited that way. Another critique I have of this movie is the way that foul language was so overused. It was indeed needed for the correct feel of many sequences, but every single character in the movie repeatedly used language that could not be aired on cable television in every scene. Even Michael Caine's character, who was supposed to be a sophisticated man from an earlier and simpler generation, used such language commonly. It really took away from him the air of sophistication. Overall, if you enjoy tragic moral tales, you can't find a more honest one than this, though I believe the script needed to be edited and cleaned up a bit. If you are not interested in a melancholy movie peppered with foul language and sexual dialogue, Do Not watch this Movie. I still give it a rating of 6 however, because it was very honest with a truthful moral.A slight annoyance I have with this movie that has nothing to do with the film itself, is the way the trailers sold it. My family went to see this movie for my sister's birthday because she thought it looked funny. Now, my sister was turning 21 so it wasn't anything over her head, but the trailers made this movie seem humorous. You would need to have an excessively dark sense of humor to laugh at anything that you didn't see in the trailers(Even at the packed showing I was at, there were few moments where there was laughter, and fewer moments where that laughter was louder than a soft chuckle.) Also, the trailers give away the entire storyline, they tell you of how things are bad with his Kids and how people throw things at him, then they showed you the turning point(s) in the story with Nicolas Cage talking to Michael Cain and Nicolas Cage shooting targets, and finally it shows Cage walking down the street smiling with a bow on his shoulder. This, good people, is every single event in the movie that directly affected the main plot line. There were plenty of smaller incidents that helped the film along, and a couple of sub-plots that the trailers didn't mention, but the entire main story of the film is spoiled for you in the trailers. Sure it gets butts in the seats, but it ruins the movie for them. \n",

It was a very good story line but I don't think it was necessary to have the characters swearing every second word. The characters in this movie were constantly saying the f word as if it was all the writers could think of to make the movie longer. If they were to remove the swearing the movie would have probably been 15 min shorter. The story line was absolutely the best though really enjoyed the story and Micheal Caine's did an excellent job portraying his role. Mr. Cage was also great in this movie.

Blockbuster and Netflix should not waste their money on DVD distribution.A surprisingly dark genre with 100% negativity for the first thirty minutes. At this point the wife and I departed the theater. This film IS NOT for optimistic and positive minded people.We didn't check reviews before we attended. Why?

Another shortcoming is the absence of any real plot. It is similar to the movie \"Sideways\" in this respect, but \"Sideways\" does a much better job at getting a message across without a tangible plot. \"The Weatherman\" is basically an hour and a half of Nick Cage's character getting crapped on by his friends, family, and life in general. The schizophrenic comedy portions only serve to confuse the viewer and offer no real substance or viable humor. \n",

Not only does it fail to add any value to the film, the viewer is just left wondering why it was used at all. The film is slow and boring with Cage providing a narration of situations throughout. I am surprised that actors as talented and successful as Caine and Cage would lower themselves to something like this. After 45 minutes and more than a dozen other patrons before us, my wife and I left the sneak preview feeling like we should ask for a refund.

      " In 'The Weather Man' Nicolas Cage is David Spritz, a local weatherman in Chicago. Despite all his success, neither David nor his estranged family are happy and he can not figure out why.I did not think this movie was particularly great. Nicolas Cage is really good and takes a departure from some of his usual roles. Normally he has played lovable characters, while here he plays a jerk. He is a jerk to his fans and his wife. He can not figure out why people do not like him and it makes him miserable. Nevertheless, everything seems to go his way despite his inability to get close to anyone. Cage plays a pathetic character and it takes tragedy to get his life together. His solution? He runs away and finds himself through archery. Kind of stupid I think.All in all, I liked Cage and the way he played his character. However, the plot did not impress me a whole lot. \n",

Where other people see quirky slapstick humor in events such as Cage getting hit with numerous drinks thrown at him from the public, to me it is nothing but infuriatingly annoying.In summation - do not waste your time or money with this movie. \n",

The music used in the trailer actually appeared very little in the film, instead a ticking clock sound is used, though meant to show the monotony of life etc, gets pretty annoying rather quickly.The film follows Dave Spritz's (Nicholas Cage) life and career, which he finds unfulfilling and the problems with his family. The actors are all very good in the film, Nicholas Hoult (about a boy) is very convincing as a troubled teenager and his American accent is faultless. This film is unusual in its lack of comedy, romance and action. These do not necessarily have to be negative traits, however the film attempts to make clever points about life, yet never quite succeeds.The film appears to lack any specific resolution, leaving you unsatisfied at the end. I really do not recommend seeing it on your birthday, as I did, or at any other time if you can help it. \n",

      " Save your money. Save your time. Save your soul. What a lousy movie. I gave this a rating of 2 (out of 10). I don't think I have ever rated a movie that low on IMDb before. I can only think of a couple of movies I have seen in my life that I think were worse. That's saying a lot.First off, this movie isn't in the least bit funny. For some reason, maybe its my own poor perception, I thought this was going to be a comedy. I can accept responsibility for having the wrong impression. But, it wasn't any good other than that, and that isn't my fault. No, I just opened another instance of IE and see the movie is listed as a comedy, so I am not just imagining that it was supposed to be funny. It isn't.Next, it is vulgar. Just look at the Quote listed on the main page to get an idea. It is my fault that I took my mother-in-law to an R rated movie, but this movie is just vulgar anyway. It feels like a 12 year old wrote some of these parts where they think saying a bad word is funny regardless of the context, just because it is a bad word. I remember jokes like that when I was a child. You know the one where a child hears his parents use foul language and when he asks them the meaning of the words, they give him an alternate definition? Then, when the family pastor comes by, the child spews garbage from his mouth using the words he has heard his family use, but with the definitions the parents gave. These jokes usually end with something like \"...and mom is in the kitchen fu..... the turkey\". Yeah, this movie is funny, just like that.I had hoped for more. There is a narrative style to the movie reminiscent of American Beauty, but, what a disappointment. This is no American Beauty. For that matter it is no American Pie, nor any other movie I can think of beginning with American. Michael Caine was the single bright spot of the movie, and I am a Cage fan.Of course, you will see a plethora of posts on how great this movie is. They will say I didn't get it. That I am not smart enough to understand this movie. That I don't understand the {insert academic drivel here}. And, if you are one of those people that seem to like the movies most people think are a waste of time, then this one is for you.Otherwise, wait for this one to come on cable...and then change the channel real fast. You'll be glad you did. Try as I might, I just won't be able to give you your 101 minutes back.Lastly, this movie failed my most basic test of whether I will recommend it or not. That test is, \"did I look at my watch?\" If I did, the movie doesn't get a recommendation. If I am looking at my watch trying to figure out when it will all be over, the movie fails. This one had me shaking my watch just to make sure it was still working.Good luck. \n",

Dave is a middle aged man with a great career that just got better but his family life is only getting worse. Coming off a divorce and having two children (one a rebellious teenage boy and the other a \"grossly overweight\" girl) it doesn't seem like his life can get any worse. This film is beautifully made. Coming off of movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean and The Ring, Gore Verbinski makes a wonderful transition into the world of drama and comedy. Nicholas Cage does an excellent job in this role. You get the sense that he is trying to make things work but naturally just can't do it. Michael Caine does well in a supporting role as David's father and Hope Davis does a great job as David's ex-wife. Hope Davis has made a fine transition from independent to Hollywood in this movie. This movie truly is inspiring. When you walk out of the theater you will feel great. This movie has the perfect blend of Comedy and Drama.

      " Caught a sneak preview of this movie last night and fell in love with it. An earlier review compared it to \"American Beauty\" and there are some parallels, but \"The Weather Man\" has more outrageous humor and centers on the daily struggle of living rather than the complete turnaround of Lester Burnham. It also captures the awkwardness of living, growing up, and being an adult.Dave Spritz, played fantastically by Nicolas Cage, is a man with good intentions who has a hard time translating that into his behavior and actions. He makes a lot of mistakes, some of which are ridiculously funny, but some painful to see. He's at a crucial juncture in his life and fumbling through it in a human way. That is endearing or annoying for people to see (my friend and I had totally different reactions to the things he did). There is a lot of narration that really gets you in the head and perspective of Dave (and is comic relief).Robert Spritz, Dave's father, is the impeccable Michael Caine. A celebrated author, Robert is aloof and extremely caring at the same time. Dave wants to impress him but seems to fail miserably, while Robert offers his blunt opinions on his son and grandchildren. He is clearly trying to understand and help his son (and grandchildren) while facing his own big issues. The relationship between these two is moving and realistic.Hope Davis is decent as Dave's wife Noreen. Dave's children do well enough with their roles, but the son's American accent is terrible. (We'll forgive him because his acting is not bad.) They are a big part of the story, but the focus is really on Dave Spritz's struggle with disappointment and in general, facing uphill battles. This movie has heart and leaves the audience with a clear message about life that is worth experiencing through the story. \n",

I have been fearing that a movie starring Nick (and same with Kevin -- at least Waterworld had action) would come out and be as bland as his acting; now it has. This biography of a normal, uneventful, topically messed-up life of the average, albeit rich, human being is just the kind of movie that would expose Nick's underachieving style of acting that underrates the talent an actor of his status has.The plot is about a man finding himself by overcoming the burden of his wants for the burden of his needs. The writers missed two very crucial takes that would have clearly shown his former life was going to have meaning without him by having the deer hunt with his daughter that would be her \"rock\" (meaning) during her bland life and David's Father last scene in the car telling him, \"it's not just wind, it's the paper you write on while telling your stories to your reader's. David, you and I are the same-- we tell fiction to an eager audience that cares.\"If I wanted to view this movie again, I would become a psychiatrist or an attorney for which this movie must be a complete bore. \n",

One of the hardest working actors out there, just have a look at his IMDb profile and see how many films this guy has coming out in the next 1-2 years. Sure he has had his flops ( nobody's perfect) however this is not one of them. Solid cast involved all around especially Michael Caine who plays Cage's father in this film. Yes i know this movie has been out for awhile and i admit a few slip under my radar but thats the beauty of IMDb.com i was looking at his list of work he has done and picked like 4-5 films i have yet to see (I'm talking about nic Cage that is). In this movie he is Weather reporter Dave Spirtz. A man who's been recently divorced from his wife, has a son and daughter who both desperately need him and an ailing father to look after. On top of that he is getting disrespected from certain members of the community, some of them actually drive by and throw stuff at him (something i still couldn't understand why?) He needs to confront his life and get it on the right path before it all quickly disintegrates. A good compelling movie from one of the best actors as far as i'm concerned in the business. \n",

      " Rated R for Strong Language and Sexual Content.The Weather Man is a comedy/drama film from Gore Verbinski(director of the Pirates Of The Carribian trilogy).It stars Nicholas Cage.Its funny at times and overall a decent film but it was a bit boring.The film is about a chicago weather man who is for the most part hated.He gets plenty of things such as food and drinks thrown at him.He has two kids with his ex-wife.Throughout the movie he tries to reconcile his relationship with his family(his ex-wife, his kids and his parents).The Weather man is a decent film that's fairly funny at times but overall a bit boring.I guess it wouldn't hurt to rent it. \n",

      " Nicolas Cage is as you all know, an underestimated actor in general. We often think of him as boring and straightforward in his order of appearances. But I think not. Take movies such as \"snakeeyes or the one where he bench presses a pretty woman (Junior),, he performers excellent.In this movie I'd say he's great once again. His personality is actually quite intriguing in this movie, but at the same kind of funny.The plot I guess you can read in other commentary's,, so I'll leave it there.. Whats different with this movie is that Michael Caine actually is not boring, he always plays a boring part in most movies,, but not in this one...Se ya.. \n",

      " That camel toe sequence alone was worth the price of admission. I couldn't believe how uncomfortably funny it was, but it wasn't left for just a laugh, but rather it also had created something poignant out of it that had lessons about perspective and how attitude is everything. I loved it. Cried and laughed all at once.The rest of the movie I don't care to comment on, rather, I'm just writing gibberish to fulfill the 10 lines of text that IMDb requires in their guidelines. So basically go out and watch this movie and watch it for the camel toe sequence. It was so awesome that Spritz went right back to the clothing shop and bought his little girl dresses to address the camel toe situation. Very cute movie. That fat little girl stole the whole movie. \n",

      " The Weather Manh as three amazingly talented actors in Nicolas Cage, Micheal Caine, and Hope Davis. It has a director who's films have often been dumb(The Mexican, Mouse Hunt) but have sometimes been great(Pirates of the Caribbean) The Weather Man had the potential to be a great film, it unfortunately fell short, mostly because of the increasingly depressing story line. Not that I don't love depressing story lines some times but this one just didn't seem to have any real point. The script was well written but as mentioned earlier didn't come up with any reason why the characters would be how they are and although I think they are trying to come up with something more realistic so they are depressed because of many small things instead of one big thing they just never establish any things no matter how small. The performances are pretty good as is the musical score but The Weather Man fails in almost every other place it possibly could fail in. It suffers from trying to hard. \n",

      " All fiction is about the suspension of disbelief, but sometimes the divide between the real world and the created fiction is such a chasm that even those with noble purpose fail. And that IMHO is what is wrong with this movie. The protagonist, a smiley-faced TV weather man named Dave Spritz (Nicholas Cage), is presented as a hapless soul who somehow, despite no really striking abilities, is very successful at earning a living, but is completely unable at understanding or accepting himself, and, as a consequence, is not able to be successful at being a good husband, father and son, although he desperately desires to be all three.The script gives Spritz all the accouterments of upper middle class success including a big suburban home in which his ex-wife and children live, a trendy Chicago apartment for himself, and some quirks: a 14 year old son with a drug problem who is being hit on by his pedophile counselor, and a 12 year old daughter who is seriously overweight and bored with life. The ex-wife is is an attractive but bland individual with an equally bland boyfriend/fiancée. Spritz also has a kind but judgmental father, a famous writer, who is dying of cancer.The drama centers around Spritz coming to an epiphany of sorts by accepting the mediocrity of himself and his life while at the same time pursuing a lucrative new job as the weatherman on a New York morning show. Along the way he learns archery, accepts the fact that he will never be a writer like his father, and gets sloshed by a lot of fast food thrown at him on the street by less than adoring fans.There is no Hollywood ending, but this is nevertheless a Hollywood movie in its striking lack of reality, depth and complexity in the characters and the situations it creates. If you are going to make a downer of a movie, at least make it more interesting. \n",

      " The was an interesting film, though somewhat of an enigma. It was another case of the previews doing the movie no justice. When I saw the trailers to this movie it looked to me like it would be another \"family film,\" I expected it to be like Family Man. However, this movie was much darker, and much better than \"Family Man\" in fact it learned much more towards another cage film \"Lord of War,\" simply due to the narration and the dark and satirical look at real life. That being said I do have to admit that at the end of the movie I was a little unsatisfied. The entire film seemed to be leading up to some big event which, depending on your point of view may or may not have been a big deal. The supporting characters where little more than skin deep while they did seem the have some back-story, they still felt quite shallow. I think this was all a result of scripting, as the acting for the most part was superb.Overall this movie had the feel of one of those re-examine your life movies, but in the end falls short. I give this movie a six because while it is somewhat weak in many areas it is definitely better then your average cinema. \n",

      " This is a dark comedy, and I think a lot of the gripes that come from people center around the idea that they were going to see a regular comedy, which would make them understandably disappointed after watching it. Even as a dark comedy though, I found it lacking severely in humor and message. To be sure, there are some memorable scenes that deserve a nod, but as a whole I don't think the film accomplishes anything that it might have set out to do. After watching, you get the feeling most of the movie that was shot might have ended up on the cutting room floor and thats why this flick doesn't really make much sense. Is it considered more of a \"deep\" movie? Sure. But that doesn't mean that if you don't appreciate it in it's entirety it is because you are incapable of \"getting\" it, rather you don't particular care for the way this flick comes across. Don't be surprised if you find this movie lacking in purpose or success and are labeled \"shallow\" or unable to appreciate true cinema. Just because a film is categorized as a complex piece of work doesn't mean it is above reproach or criticism. Far from it, our standards should be higher when judging a movie of this type.It isn't laugh out loud funny, and only squeaks by as a dark comedy in the loosest sense. It appeals to a large number of people who battle depression everyday, as the main character seems to, but if you aren't hooked on Prozac you aren't likely to sympathize with the \"poor main character who works 14 hours a week and makes 6 figures a year\".Yes, in his pursuit of what he thinks will solve all of his problems (a better job) he realizes what is really important to him. Or he doesn't. I forget, I was counting how many times he was hit with fast food and how old that became halfway through the film, despite the directors attempt to turn that fast food assaults into a deep metaphor for the way people live. Now THAT made me laugh.It isn't a great movie, and you should feel free to say that if you want to without fearing that some will accuse you of being a shallow action-movie-junkie. I would recommend that you skip it, unless you have nothing else to do or watch. If you find yourself unable to get out of seeing it, or you just are curious, let me do you a favor: Turn it into a drinking game.1 shot = hit with fast food, 2 shots = hit with liquid, 3 shots = the main character cussesEnjoy. \n",

      " If the words \"shit\" and \"fuck\" were removed from the dialogue the movie would be a silent one. How many times does one need to hear these words in a movie - a hundred? a thousand? This is a sad and disappointing movie. Michael Caine's pseudo-accent was the worst since Dick Van Dyck in \"Mary Poppins\" and his role was utterly pointless. Nicholas Cage did not know whether he was acting in a comedy or a tragedy. The marriage seems to have broken up for little reason and the wife seemed to be happily involved with someone else awfully soon. The children are completely unconnected with their parents. Is this what is happening in affluent neighbourhoods in America today? If so, there is a huge tragedy unfolding before our very eyes. \n",

      " The Weather Man left me disappointed and feeling cheated. The movie is set in Chicago, but the weather is unrealistically dreary. Nicholas Cage gives us Robert Spritz. Robert Spritz is a man-child: immature and underdressed for a successful Chicago weatherman. His children have problems with drugs and obesity. Michael Caine plays Robert's father, David Spritzel, a Pulitzer Prize winning author. Robert feels inferior compared to his father, and struggles to live up to his father's legacy. Grandfather David interferes with the raising of Robert's son and daughter, even going directly to Robert's ex-wife on an issue. The movie sets up these characters, and throws all sorts of calamities at them as a metaphor for life's unfairness. For me, the plot does not lead to the ending; it is too much of a reach. I did not connect with the characters and their problems. I cannot recommend this movie to you.Bob \n",

      " The Weather Man is very subtle. It's like a good poem. There's message on the surface that most people think is pretentious or dull and then there's the underlying message that is simply beautiful. Dave Spritz (Nicholas Cage) is a man who forecasts the weather and predicts things yet he cannot get a handle on his own life and the direction it is heading.His father (Michael Cane) is an accomplished writer and successful father, so says David. David can't figure out why he's failed and in one beautiful scene between David and his father, his father explains to David that it's not about planning, foresight or any of that. It's about doing. At some point, you just have to do it.This movie is subtle and most people won't like it. If you want to analyze a movie, see this. The writing is probably the best I've seen in a long time. \n",

      " The images in the film are exquisite. Cinematography gorgeous. The camera movement is minimal and careful -- with placement to tell the story masterfully done and also giving the film the feeling of both arm's length (the emotional state of Cage's character) and of a sort of zen spareness that is refreshing in films. I was feeling almost like Cage's self-sabotage-like depression was becoming tedious and then the film blossomed, and I have been thinking about it ever since. This movie, like a ribbon, ties everything together in the last 5 or 10 minutes in a way that delivers a real wallop to the heart and the mind -- it's a beautiful film that suddenly blooms in a sense of clarity and insight that was like saying, \"Ah!\" And it doesn't resort to violence as an easy answer, as something one would expect in films nowadays, but rather brings it up -- the urge to be violent -- as a very real human feeling, but one that we need to struggle with -- just as we do with love, anger, desire, etc. How wonderful to see great casting like this -- the daughter (Gemmenne de la Pena) is so good in her role, and it's even more impressive to the film because it is so complex for movie-goers to not be judgmental when only used to seeing rail-thin women. The son too -- a wonderful performance (Nicholas Hoult with an American accent). Hope Davis is always fantastic.Hans Zimmer's music is terrific. It doesn't get in the way of the film, but serves and complements is beautifully.And the characters, complicated and human in their behaviors and personalities -- not cut-out archetypes of good or bad or loving husband or absent father... Instead, this film showed how life IS complex, how people make decisions that lead to what happens to them, and that we can all come to terms with that, to accept ourselves as who we are. The commentary on what it is to be American is so subtle and interesting -- what a delightful, thought-provoking part of a film! \n",

      " I went and saw this movie with about 10 other people in the audience. I laughed and cried (literally), but this is not the point. This movie got to me because it was about life. It didn't take a situation and escalate the problems only to fix them in the last ten minutes with all the characters a little wiser and ridiculously happy, it just told a story of a lonely guy who made a few mistakes and although he wants to fix them just can't seem to do it and how he copes. It is just his life that he created from his choices not from unexpected and unlikely surprises that most movies try to throw out there and call normal. Those are only normal because of how often we see them in movies. It is our choices that shape our life and the choices of others. This movie just tells where his choices have lead him and what he wants to change. After the movie, I hope that those other 10 people who saw the movie when I did were made to think about reality like I was. \n",

      " This film was often so close to the mark on situations I have been through, that it was difficult to watch. Dave (Cage) is a seemingly successful weatherman, making great money, but that is just what's on the surface. His personal life is a complete mess: he can't seem to connect with his kids, his estranged wife can't stand to be around him and his father (Michael Caine) almost seems embarrassed to be related to him. There are many situations where Dave, while a grown man, is disappointing to his father,(even on something small like buying him a paper or a coffee when he asks for one) something we get the feeling he has been doing all his life.Growing up, we all see ourselves becoming successful, but we never seem to factor in that the personal side of our lives might not follow the same path. In Dave's case, he truly can't have it all. It's refreshing to see that not everything turns out just the way he planned, everything is not neatly tied up in a bow. Movies these days seem to be hitting the mark more closely when it comes to realism, better reflecting what the everyman goes through, whether he's apparently successful or a complete failure.No matter what happens, life goes on... \n",

      " Really enjoyed this film. It's funny how \"Napoleon Dynamite\" has changed the world of quirky film-making. We saw it in Miranda July's \"Me and you and everyone we know\" this past summer, and now we have \"The Weather Man,\" with a similarly quirky score and sense of humor. The difference is that \"The Weather Man\" is not parody so much as a portrait of real life without the rose-colored camera lens. It's moving without being sentimental. Funny while staying true to the essence of its message. I personally wanted a little something more out of the ending but the film was even and consistent and that's already a lot for a film to accomplish these days. The director has a great eye for humor and Nicolas Cage. as always, is spot-on. \n",

It has beautiful shots of Chicago in the Winter and some really good acting. Ultimately \"The Weather Man\" fails because it entails a bunch of problems for the lead character, but never resolves them.The first half of the film has some good laughs, but the second half is depressing and it never resolves any of the situations. The film ends as if the screenwriter simply ran out of ideas. In particular, the subplot with the son could have been cut out completely and the film would have better continuity.This is Gore Verbinski's most ambitious film, but I don't think it will be very successful. It's a shame because it could have been so much better. \n",

Michael Caine was good even though he was only in it for ten minutes all up. Gemmenne De la Pena played the daughter Shelly. She was and good so was her camel toe. Last but not least Nicholas Hoult(all grown up after About a Boy)was good as the son of Nicolas Cage.

      " I imagine The Weather Man came to be through a thought process that went something like this: \"Hey, nobody's ever made a movie about the weather guy before! Nobody ever thinks about the weather guy. He has feelings too! I should make a movie about a weather guy to show they're not just lite 'n' happy smilers all the time!\" Well, this movie does just that, and that is the main reason why I dislike it.Nicolas Cage, in the latest of his near identical roles of late, stars as the aforementioned weather guy. He's separated from his wife, has two troubled children, lives in the shadow of his Pulitzer Prize-winning father, and, basically, everybody hates him. Aww, poor weather guy.Right off the bat, every detail of this film seems to try and mimic the critically acclaimed \"quirky\" films that have been so popular lately, such as Adaptation and Punch-Drunk Love. What director Gore Verbinski (yes, the same one who made Pirates of the Caribbean) fails to understand is that it takes more than just weird music and prolonged shots of people looking distressed to make a film on par with the two aforementioned titles. The Weather Man may have the score and the basic framework for such a film, but what it lacks is the heart, the emotion, and the passion. Adaptation and Punch-Drunk Love were beautiful films with characters I cared about and could connect with. Sure, at times they were downbeat, but the overall tones were ones of joy, hope, and the very essence of life. The Weather Man is just plain depressing. I didn't like nor care about any of the characters, and instead of having realistic, heartfelt dialogue, the film is just full of pointless vulgarity (and a lot of it, I might add).Again, using the same comparison, Punch-Drunk Love's basic theme was love conquers all  a wonderful sentiment I wholeheartedly believe in. What does The Weather Man say? Money buys happiness? Yeah, that's a great message.Don't be fooled by the fantastic trailers for this film as I was. They make it seem like an off-the-wall comedy about a weatherman who constantly has milkshakes thrown at him before finally protecting himself by carrying a bow and quiver of arrows as he walks down the street. That's a fairly minor subplot. What The Weather Man is is a relentlessly depressing film that plays like a twelve-year-old trying to mimic a grown-up: none of the soul or maturity, but a hell of a lot of swearing. But admittedly, there are roughly three chuckles sprinkled throughout the hopelessness.Now I don't know about you, but I don't want to feel despondent and dirty after watching a film like this, and all The Weather Man is going to leave you with is a black hole of \"Why would anyone want to watch that?\" \n",

This movie follows a curious recent Hollywood trend in making movies about depressed and uninteresting characters. It's too bad because there are a lot of fine things about this movie. It could have been a winner.The production values of this film are outstanding. The acting is terrific and the photography superb. Michael Caine especially gives a fine performance but even his character (as the father) doesn't care much for his son.In a way, this film reminds me of 2003's \"Lost in Translation\" which also deals with a marginal celebrity coming to grips with his shallow and meaningless life but Weatherman has a lot more going for it.If the film makers had made Cage's character a little more upbeat and had weeded out the useless profanity and the ill-advised child predator sub-plot, this could have been a movie that the whole family could enjoy. \n",

I enjoyed the realism in this film from start to finish. What a great movie!

I have been in over 30 shows and would be honored to share a set with the majority of the cast. I cannot begin to say how many memorable moments there were, my favorite being the thought process of David Spritz as he goes to the store for Tartar sauce.

This is an Oscar worthy film that shows Nicholas Cage at his best and also gives a great performance by Caine.This film is highly relate-able though not overdone. We see a man who seems to be drowning in his fallen family life. He's lost his wife, cannot find common ground with his children, and has never been able to win his fathers approval, whom he now discovers is dying.Not the most straight forward laughter, but it is there, and it is good. This film is intellectual, touching, funny, and leaves you with a new understanding of the plight of the father. \n",

      " Maybe it's just that Nicholas Cage is my favorite actor, maybe it's that Michael Caine is a great actor, maybe it's that I like subtle and dark humor, but I thought this was Cage's best work since Adaptation. Several moments in the film had laughing out loud annoyingly, it always has a very fun feeling to it. The humor is so obscure and yet very real. Constantly you look at this man and what a delusional loser he is and you never really feel sorry as much as it makes you smile. The child actors are wonderful. The daughter has this null sense of disinterest in everything that works with the comedy. The son is a bit less funny but does a great job. I recommend everybody gives this movie a chance. \n",

      " I don't get Gore Verbinski. He has shown himself to be a decent director (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) who has not yet reached his full potential. Why then, would he come out with something like Weather Man, taking him completely in the wrong direction? Weather Man is the drab story of \"weather man\" Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage), who is playing his stock character: the pathetic, stuttering, socially inept and boring every-man. This kind of role worked in Adaptation, but honestly, how much longer can Cage play the same role and get away with it? The problem I have with this movie is that it's lacking the warm heart at its core that other movies like this have. I'm not asking for a shallow and heart-warming holiday movie here, either- although that would've been nice compared to this. But I think that movies about the struggle of life and one person's coming to grip of his reality can be both sad and uplifting at the same time. Sam Mendes's American Beauty was a story about the American life (hm,covering the exact same ground as Weather Man), and how people change in it. The story is tragic and often sad, yet at the same time recognizes the beauty that is everywhere around us. Weather Man takes some of these ideas, except without the beauty. It is drab, sad, and most surprisingly, dirty.(Cage and his wife talk about the lack of enthusiasm with BJs, his young daughter Shelly is called \"camel toe\" at school, and his son is molested by his counselor, not to mention the countless needless F--- words.) I have no problem with mature content in films, but this gratuitous and unnecessary show made the story all the more sad and juvenile. But I digress.The movie is classified as drama/comedy, but it wasn't funny. I believe I chuckled (very softly) once in the movie. And that part was a scene that was in the trailer.Weather Man left me feeling hollow and unfinished, like there was still something the story had to tell. Verbinski's movie had the one half of reality - the sadness, the struggle, and the realization of one's self, but lacked the other - the fact that in the struggle is beauty and hope. At the end of the movie I had no hope for the characters. \n",

      " I agree with many of the reviewers that thought that the performances especially by Micheal Cane and Nicholas Cage were outstanding BUT over all,the movie was depressing. Nothing ever went right for the weatherman. His kids were in trouble, his father was dying, the love of his life hated him and his audience kept throwing food at him. The only thing that went right was being a weatherman,a job that even he felt did not deserve respect. There was a scene near the end of the movie where he was driving on a snow covered upper floor of a parking structure heading for the railing. I was hoping that he would step on the gas and plow through the barrier and do a Thelma and Louise. Unfortunately he parked. The best scene in the movie was a great father-son moment between Michael Cane and Nicholas Cage in a parked car. The chemistry between the two was heartfelt and the emotions rang true. There were a few laughs in the movie but this was no comedy. \n",

      " This film is more along the lines of the great French films like the L'Huitieme Jour and The Hairdressers Husband than your typical Hollywood anathema. The characters blend with distinct personalities providing a great interplay between the roles and themes. The background details and passing character shots accentuate the whole plot line, building the characters personalities by placing them in context for and adding to the interplay between them. I really enjoyed it and came away feeling refreshed and thoughtful, and can't wait to see more films along the same lines. Maybe western English films are coming of age. \n",

He could have done the same thing with his acting ability alone. I was very disappointed with him in this role. I think he should be more discerning in choosing his films. He is normally one of my favorite actors. His co-star, Michael Caine was excellent in this film, however. Take out all the profanity (it served no purpose) and perhaps this would have been a good film. I don't believe that white collar workers (weathermen included) walk around using that kind of language. Do you think Bryant Gumble talks like that all the time? \n",

      " Nick Cage's lead character Dave Schnitz the Weatherman didn't bring intellectual depth to his job, but why should he? He was just a goofy read-from-the-prompter TV weather reader with a smarmy \"Schnitz's Nipper\" gimmick(his pick for the coldest day of the week)as his greatest contribution. But, a well paid weather reader he was, and also was someone who wanted like the dickens to get his separated family back to the way it was when he was probably more miserable living with it. His new life appeared to me to be better than arguing all the time as before. Why want that life again? He had a very good paying TV job \"working\" two hours a day....what most of us wouldn't give for the options that job would give us? But, Dave was miserable even so and didn't know how well off he was. It was once again that silly film story about some people not knowing how good they have it so they work harder to improve on it but actually harm it even more than doing nothing.Dave had a unique knack for irritating his separated wife with all his dumb attempts to try to get his family back, but each new attempt failed worse than the last and drove her further away from him. Funny how movie fantasy always shows these ineffectual types to be so successful in their work, with others always giving them exaggerated tolerance, attention and acclaim, but all the ones like this I know are real no-account people with lives full of troubles. Hoo-ray for Hollywood, I guess. Not realistic at all, but the concept did make for some half-funny, but contrived, scenes along the way such as the crude \"camel toe\" running joke. However, the excessive, hammering use of crude and gross sexual slang in nearly all scenes was not at all necessary to the story, but that unfortunate development seems to be the method du jour for film comedy these days and mores the pity for that. Michael Caine as Dave's talented and successful father was great as always and the best thing in the film for his quiet and patient tolerance of his doofus son's dumb approach to all things normal and sensible. He was always calmly and lovingly trying, without much success, to get angry dork Dave to see a smarter way of living his life but had very little luck with that, and also subsequently with his own life due to terminal cancer.Dave's obese, dumb and whiny daughter made me wonder again why people have kids these days, my kids included. It reminded me that we all try so hard with them but about 90% of our efforts are mostly useless and are certainly no fun for them or us, and no more than about 10% of their entire teenage years are rewarding to us or them. But, still we try so hard, mainly because they are part of us and we just can't give up as we do love them and have high hopes they will turn out right in the end. Dave did that very same thing, over and over with little success, but his often lame and laborious efforts with his daughter did pay off some toward the end. It must work better in Hollywood than in real life. Duhhhh.The story was very contrived, lame, and forced at times, especially with Cage's part, but was more or less effective overall in telling Dave's story as the surrounding characters were well cast and convincing. I guess Nick Cage did OK, but many others would have been much funnier, like Steve Martin, John Cusack or Bill Murray, of course. Wow, Bill Murray in that role would have been magic!This was truly a summer weight movie but was released in the fall/winter due to the harsh weather that was central to the story. Anyone who thought this was a terrific movie, like the very first reviewer here, please stay out of my life. \n",

      " Nicholas Cage is on a role, with this film and the excellent Lord of War. It's not easy to play a character the audience isn't going to like, yet somehow making that character come to life and hold our interest. Yet this is what Mr. Cage does so effectively in both of these movies. His character this time is a selfish, overgrown adolescent who can't understand why his life is so crappy. He's oblivious to the fact that his ex-wife hates him and any reconciliation is out of the question. But he obviously cares about his children and wants to connect with them (some of the best sequences in the film show him doing this, often in quite tentative ways). And he wants to distinguish himself in the eyes of his famous father. He just doesn't know what to do or how to do it. He's like a big kid who's never grown up, yet during the course of the movie, he realizes that he must and begins the slow, painful process of doing so. It's a tribute to Cage that he makes this process both funny and painful at times, and even though his character is an unlikeable one (though never as unlikeable as his arms dealer in Lord of War), we're still riveted to the screen and rooting for him to change. I wasn't sure what to expect from this film--the trailer is a bit misleading in that it seems to promise an outright comedy--but I wasn't disappointed. This is one of the most complex treatments of contemporary life that a big studio has released in years. Both Cage and Michael Caine as his famous writer/father turn in acting turns that are Oscar-worthy. But I'm afraid no one will remember this little gem after another week or so. \n",

      " There were a number of movies available to me this weekend, several of which I wanted to see. With the time to see only one, however, I had to make a choice. My criteria were twofold: Which of the new releases was getting the best reviews (or at least not the worst)? And, being both tired and not feeling particularly well, which was the shortest? The Weather Man filled the bill on both counts, and so I elected to buy my tickets accordingly. Whether or not the criteria was actually more sensible than it sounds here or I got lucky, the fact remains: The Weather Man is a pretty good movie.David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is an up and coming weather man in Chicago. He enjoys his work, taking particular pride in his \"green screen\" abilities. He's good enough that a major New York morning show has extended him an invitation to audition. But even that success isn't, in David's eyes, even close to measuring up to those of his father. Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine)  David has shortened his name for TV  is an author with numerous prizes to his credit, including a Pulitzer. David is constantly trying to measure up; the elder Spritzel is consistently oblivious and critical.Whether David will admit his professional successes to himself or not, there's one thing everyone can agree on: His personal life is in a shambles. He's divorced from a woman he still loves (Noreen, played by Hope Davis); his 15 year-old son may or may not be a juvenile delinquent (Mike, played by Nicholas Hoult); his 12 year-old daughter is sullen and overweight (Shelly, played by Gemmenne de la Pena); and the chubby and obsequious Russ (Michael Rispoll) is dating his ex-wife and horning in on his family.David does all he can to get closer to both his father and his son. He conscientiously tries to bring Shelly out of her shell. He even wants to attempt a reconciliation with his wife. But when Mike's rehab counselor, Don (Gil Bellows) starts cozying up to David's son, and at the same time the elder Spritzel experiences a health crisis, David doesn't know what to do next. Predictably, whatever he does doesn't work out quite the way he hopes.Nicolas Cage has long been one of my favorite actors. He tends to choose quirky roles, and they're perfect for him. David Spritz is no exception. Hope Davis and Michael Rispoll are fine in limited roles; Gil Bellows is more than a little surprising as a counselor who may or may not have a dark side. Michael Caine, of course, is spot on as a distant father who isn't really cold; he just isn't quite sure how to get along with a son who's so dramatically different from him and his own lifestyle and desires. The children, too, acquit themselves well, most notable Gemmenne de la Pena who's both heart-wrenching and funny to watch.The Weather Man is, surprisingly, directed by Gore Verbinski (best known for the mega-hit Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl). That may, in fact, be the only misstep in the film. Verbinski does a perfectly fine job, but it's impossible not to wonder if perhaps a more artistic director could have wrung more out of the film than a man best known for his action direction. Meanwhile, I can't imagine even a bad director being able to completely ruin a movie that has such a stellar script as does The Weather Man.Those of you who read these reviews regularly know that I'm a big Charlie Kaufman fan (he wrote Adaptation and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, among other things). And until I saw the closing credits, I actually thought that The Weather Man might be an understated Kaufman effort. It isn't. The writer is Steven Conrad who, with this film, has set himself a very high bar indeed.The Weather Man is filled with dark humor and wrenching drama; it's riddled with the quirks and foibles that every man (and woman) has, but that few exhibit to any but their closest friends and family. To write such a script is nothing short of terrific; to get someone like Nicolas Cage to headline the resulting film is singularly appropriate. The movie is dry, to be sure, and deceptively matter-of-fact. It's not going to be everybody's cup of tea. But for those who like this sort of thing, The Weather Man is a real jewel in a fall movie schedule filled almost entirely with Oscar hopefuls and mass-appeal action films.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Weather Man is rated R for \"strong language and sexual content.\" Frankly, I think that there are some things here that younger teens could benefit from seeing, not the least of which are the attempts of two fathers to better know and relate to their children. If you've got teens who appreciate dry humor and melodramatic situations, The Weather Man isn't a bad suggestion for the whole family. I'd suggest this movie for those of about age 14 and up. Meanwhile, for the true movie aficionado, there's much to recommend The Weather Man, not least of which is that wholly wonderful script! \n",

The hair mostly did it I guess?Would recommend to any guy between 30 & 50. The audience at our theater was all between 40 and 60 years of age. Didn't know what to expect but was surprised.

On top of that it was deeply depressing, full of unlovable characters and Michael Caine doing an American accent so awful only Jason Statham has done worse.The marriage was horrible, Gil Bellows' character was foul and you knew almost immediately what was going to happen with him and the son; Cage's character is tragic; his daughter is sad and the camel toe jokes horribly misplaced (I wasn't offended, just appalled); the name calling between Cage and his wife's lover school ground stuff and pathetic.So we switched it off and watched Naked Gun to cheer us up.If this is comedy I'd never want to see a funny film again.Just dreadful.

I was in the news business and it's true, being a weatherman is a cakewalk. You get paid a ton of money and work two hours a day. That part was TRUE. What isn't true, is that weathermen are sometimes sad. I have never met a sad weatherman. Nick Cage was SAD BIG TIME. His pathetic daughter was hard to watch. It was touching however, the way Nick Cage reached out to her in an effort to make her better. Micheal Caine delivered more goods than the Red Cross delivers to Cambodia. He played the stoic father who never really connected to Nick Cage. The city of CHICAGO looked very cool though, and COLD to boot. The ICE on LAKE MICHIGAN was cold looking. I would have HATED to swim in that lake at that time of year. The WIFE of Nick Cage was a royal BIT*H. I would have been so upset with my WIFE (if I had one) if she threw a fit over TARTER SAUCE. I mean, good grief. Bryant Gumble did not deliver the goods. He played HIMSELF. However, the fact that Nick Cage kept his cool when somebody threw a BIG GULP onto him was amazing.

Verbinski is proving himself to be one of the best directors in Hollywood, perhaps just behind Steven Soderberg but ahead of the rest. Cage is great and it's his best performance, most nuanced and complete since \"Leaving Las Vegas\". You're drawn into this sad sacks life...and thought process very effectively...It's an existential film with comedy and heart. I've seen a few reviews so far. One of the best film writers writing right now is at the Los Angeles Times (Corrina Chacano -- not sure of the spelling) -- she wrote a perceptive review and rated the film highly, seemed to love it in fact. Also saw some predictable negative reviews by people like Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal -- if you get a chance, read the review, it's a lesson in what a review shouldn't be. It's all about this one guy's taste and doesn't address the mastery of the film-making. It's also poorly written -- note his tropical storm in the midwest line...very funny. Anyway, seems like people on the IMDb are already on to a good thing with how they're rating and writing about this gem. It's a great film and should get all kinds of award noms -- which means it probably won't. \n",

      " Although The Weather Man has some very good acting in it, I can't really think of any reason why it was made, except that screenwriter needed a cathartic release for some issues he had with his father. This is an extremely depressing film, and so difficult to watch that I actually couldn't get through it—and I watch every movie Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine make.Nicolas Cage plays the role that endears him in audiences' hearts the most: a well-meaning but hapless hero trying to get his ducks in a row. His ex-wife, Hope Davis, vehemently hates him and even though they try to get along for the sake of their children, Gemmenne de la Pena and Nicholas Hoult, their group therapy sessions don't go well. He tries to help his children through their troubles while dealing with his own problems at work and tense relationship with his father, Michael Caine.If you have issues with your father, I highly recommend you stay far away from this movie, since the scenes with Michael Caine will probably send you in search of your hankie. Then again, if you have a relatively perfect life with no problems with your parents, children, or ex-spouse, you probably won't want to sit through such a depressing movie. Die-hard fans of Nicky Cage might be able to watch it in its entirety, though, since he does do a very good job. \n",

      " The Weather Man is a film that plays better as a parallel to how Nicolas Cage is viewed in real life than it does as a feature film. That's not to say that the film isn't well made, I just don't think it has a lot to say, especially as it holds up over a decade later.Not many people like Cage anymore. After being an acclaimed award winning actor in the 90's, he fell off in popularity after making questionable career choices time after time. I've never had any reason not to like him, but I've also never been blown away by any of his performances (not including Leaving Las Vegas which I haven't seen). Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago weather man who is liked by no one and seems to have everything go wrong with his life. Within the first 15 minutes, I found myself cringing at the way he lived his life. Buying a coffee instead of a newspaper for his father, letting his young daughter walk home by herself, and even throwing a snowball at his ex-wife in order to keep her attention? Not exactly the most productive way to gain people's admiration.The Weather Man is about as bland as you think a real weather man's daily life would be, and the film plays off those stereotypes. But it's difficult to ever get behind a character that can't figure out his priorities in life when he only works a few hours a day, gets paid over 200 thousand dollars a year, and lives in the greatest city in the world. Now, I understand that it just uses the occupation as a backdrop for a story about a man who has nothing go right in his life. The problem is, the number one thing that I look for in a movie is if I can get behind the characters and root for them. If I'm being honest, I was finding some enjoyment in just how poorly this man's day was going. I think if Spritz didn't make everything about himself, I could have shown some more compassion.The performances are fine, including supporting turns from Michael Caine, Hope Davis, and a young Nicholas Hoult, but they're nothing spectacular. There are several unnecessary scenes, including one really awkward scene with a sexual predator. It's built around Cage's performance and it's not exactly one that carries much weight. The best thing I can say is that there isn't a ton to dislike, but there's much to like either.+Semi-interesting look into a weather man's life-Bland-Truly cringe worthy moments5.3/10 \n",

      " Unlike most Hollywood films, yet like quite a few -honest or not -rebelious ones, this one is supposed to censure and pull up the modern American way of life and its values. The thing is that this concept has already got a little old fashioned already. And in the \"weather man\" seems to get over reacting and somehow excessive too. Watching the film i couldn't help wondering what the weather man's problem really was. And all i could see is that the problem was exclusively his. He was not any specially intelligent or gifted person, yet he had a good job, the \"system\" seemed to be anything but against him, he had no debts, he had not cheated anyone or stolen anything, he was a decent person. OK, he was separated and his teen-aged children had a few problems but that's not anything most people do not have to deal with all over the world, so all the fuss was more or less about his own unstable character and had nothing to do with problems coming from any \"bad system\" or any \"evil society\". Not that a man's internal instability is not a problem itself, and not that the world around us is always as ideal as we would like it to be, yet i don't think that in the case of this film's main character's occasion it's the system to blame for the troubles he faces or better thinks he does.The fact that the film does not see it this way trying to convince us that the situation it illustrates is similar to the one we were acquainted with in the \"american beauty\" is its main weakness i am afraid, that's why i find it a little irrelevant. Not bad but a little overblown. \n",

      " I like Nick Cage and he did OK in this low-rate film playing a confused, self-centered jerk. The story was shallow, pretending to be deep. Fat daughter, semi-loser son, distant father, cute ex-wife...all the elements of a contrived plot. I have almost a normal IQ and could not figure out what message this movie sent, other than that some lives are empty. What were the bows and arrows about? I thought maybe we'd see a ripoff of \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\" or \"Nineteen Minutes\". We did not. No love, no action, no humor, no ideas, nothing. Take out the stuff that made no sense and there would be no movie. M. Caine is normally wonderful, but played a semi-comatose father of Cage. Why is Caine dying of cancer? \"Why?\" would be a question applicable to every aspect of this movie. If you think to pay to watch it...beware. Watching it for free is a waste of time. \n",

Morose youth, their vivacity subsumed in a clumsy counterpoint of the mid life crises of the protagonists! Yes, there is is, the dignified terminal illness! Aaah, a rapid flash of bouncing tit-flesh, a brief moment of joie de vivre, rapidly and permanently stifled by the crushing burden of first world ennui.Let's be clear, if you want stylish French verite, watch a French film.The Hollywood version is a painfully clumsy pastiche, stumbling from cliché to cliché in a rote, barely aware fashion.This is a dire, dreadful, awful, miserable, grind of a film, with no redeeming features.

      " That awkward movie where a sixteen year old does a better American accent than Michael Caine. That was weird, but the movie was just what I was looking for last night. A simple light drama (or dark comedy) that deals with heavy dramatic themes but doesn't explore them too much and always keeps the tone relatively easy. I wish they would make more films like this, they aren't the big money-makers or the big awards grabbers but they are always solid and easy watches. It definitely doesn't do anything majorly unique or strong, but it was still a good watch.Nicolas Cage delves into worthwhile territory again, just to keep people aware of the fact that he actually can be a good actor when he's not being the hilarious self-parody that he typically is these days. I also thought that the tone was done quite well. It's shot in a very crisp way, with an interesting score that makes the film it's own without trying to make it too \"quirky\" and distracting from the story and characters. The final act is a disaster where everything gets rushed and wrapped up much too quickly, but aside from that the film was an easy and harmless work that was just the kind of thing I wanted to watch. \n",

      " I did not know what to expect before watching this movie so luckily I had low expectations. The film is very much a non-event with very little of note happening throughout. Nicolas Cage plays the title character of The Weather Man working in Chicago and portrays it as a job that he finds easy but has little fulfilment from his life having separated from his wife (Hope Davis) and has two children who are struggling through life in different ways.The main highlights of the film are the scene's with Cage's character's dad, brilliantly played by Michael Caine. These are the only real comedic and memorable moments in an otherwise dull film. If you want to watch a Cage comedy then both Matchstick Men and Adaptation are far superior to this effort from the director of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. \n",

Its probably more useful a movie for psychoanalysis course as an example of how to recognize depression.Its a good thing I didn't pay to see this movie and borrowed it.

      " The Weather Man is a dark movie about a handful of dysfunctional characters lead by David Spritz (played by Nicolas Cage). David Spritz has a narcissistic personality disorder...though that is not explained in the movie, that is what he has. He is always focused on himself to the exclusion of his family as well as strangers.One of the main problems I saw in this movie is that David Spritz is not a particularly sympathetic character. He undergoes a change in the movie but it is not too significant. His father, Robert (played by Michael Caine) also undergoes a minor change in the movie. The children undergo the greatest change.The acting is excellent as well as the camera work. In spite of that, it left me feeling empty because the ending didn't achieve what one would have hoped---whether it is positive or negative---the goal is to be moved. I was not moved.The movie is rather crass at times...sometimes is mildly humorous.My feeling is that The Weather Man tried very hard to be American Beauty and it failed. I personally think that American Beauty is one of the greatest films ever created.If you are a student of film, rent it and watch it. Then watch American Beauty again. You will know what I mean... \n",

      " This film was an inbetweener by Gore Verbinski, squeezed into his schedule between Pirates 1 and 2. And you can really tell. Maybe Verbinski was distracted with attempting to plan a way to translate to ridiculous scripts of the sequels and completely forgot he was making this movie. Well, whichever way, every film he's made since The Black Pearl has been god awful.Only brilliant directors can fit in movie's to be proud of during a making of a franchise they are handling also. And Verbinski is certainly not one of those. Nolan made the Prestige between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and look how brilliant that was. Greengrass made United 93 between Bourne's Supremacy and Ultimatum. Need i give any more examples? The Weather Man tries so very hard to be indie. But it fails. Cage is as excruciatingly bad as usual. And I'm pretty sure Michael Caine has never had an accent lesson in his life. The film was a \"Comedy\" but i didn't laugh once. It's script was stupid, the performances misjudged and it was so unrealistic it made me a little angry. It picked up little side plots as if it was a collector and then it just as easily threw those away to focus on the \"main\" plot of Nicolas Cage. And to be honest i would rather watch paint dry. \n",

      " Before I address the plot and characters, I'd like to comment on the classification of this film as 'comedy'. The humor is dark-ish, cork dry and sly, the playfully artful kind that's not easy to notice but rewarding for those who do. Those who want to see American low-brow stuff should stay away. The mocked character here is the part of David Spritz, which seems to be written for Nicolas Cage. Spritz's exactly the kind of character Cage often gets type-casted as. Maybe it's his own fault, he does tend to use the same mannerisms in almost all of his characters but almost any actor has a style, versatility is a gift few have. I do appreciate his way of acting, he has a sort of intensity that always convinces me of the sincerity of the character. Never does he feel fake or insufficiently committed to his role.More so than the acting, the story was interesting. I found the theme and morals of the film easy to relate to, and even though the film had many typical moments (we see in many films of this specific genre) something about it felt special and the viewing experience was exhilarating for me for reasons hard to explain but I'll try anyway.It was really interesting to see so many realistic relations central in the story. The main focus is on the father-son one (Caine and Cage) but we also have a lot of parallels with the daughter-father relationship, not always subtly reoccurring themes but it got the message across. Many artsy films focus on the relationship between two characters, three at most, and the other ones are there as a curiosity (used mainly for comical purposes) or to inject some drama into the story (for example a character we know little of that dies). Here we have a lot of persons involved and they're all surprisingly well developed in the short runtime.'The Weatherman' is the appropriate title for a film about the future, about identity and expectations in life, about disappointment and hope in all things, about acceptance of your own flaws and being able to forgive others theirs. These may not be shockingly original seas to be sailed but I still was captivated by the effective storytelling and the convincing performances that really made me care a lot about the characters. Even if they are not all that likable, I see some of my own flaws reflected in theirs, which makes me empathize more with them than I would with unrealistically nice characters (the kind we see a lot in these indie-like films).The Weather Man may be a bit alternative but if you're not too biased or too easily distracted, it's a real treat. Recommended! \n",

      " Another lousy movie review is here, but I must say I stayed watching just to see how the archery gig would turn out, which evidentally had no point or conclusion.What are the odds that haters can hit someone dead on accurately with food from a moving vehicle to a walking pedestrian every time? This gimmick gets played over and over far too much and isn't even really that funny. They even have to indulge in slow motion scene after scene as this unlikeable dork, David Spritz, gets edible projectiles launched at him. Can a movie be that desperate and lacking in material that it needs to spend about fifteen minutes on such a stupid issue? But even Cage's sad sack of a character has to give long drawn narratives spoken in the typical slow annoying voice of Nicholas Cage on how he dreads his life and existence. This turns out to be very dull and execrable and just made me want to vomit.I guess it's typical for a movie with minimal substance and dialogue to take advantage of slow motion and languid dialogue to pass the time. There is really no reason I can think of to watch this crappy film and i wonder why it was even made.He's a weatherman who is going through a mid-life crisis while hanging on to a most cushy, easy and high paying job. I guess having a six figure income that only requires a couple hours a work a day is a tough means of existence. He's also divorced while his ex-wife and two kids live in a magnificent suburban mansion. His daughter is just a poor chubby, cross-eyed girl and is played very bland and uninspiring by the young actress. The son is involved in a very unnecessary relationship with his counselor who turns out to be a career pedophile. I just cringed at the scene with them in his flat taking pictures. The jokes about Spritz's daughter's camel toe is offensive and downright stupid. You can't laugh at a child that way.Toward the end I began to hate Nicholas Cage so much that I wanted to smash his face alongside a curb until green ooze poured from his orifices. I even hate Director Verbinski more for creating such a shitty movie. It's just depressing and embarrassing to watch. You'll walk out of this movie wanting to punch out anyone who was involved in this picture. \n",

      " I cannot believe people are so naive as to give this film a rating of 7 out of 10. To set the record straight, for those of you who have not watched this film, it is NOT a comedy. It did not once make me laugh. I felt like committing suicide while I watched it. The story is about a Chicago TV personality \"The Weather Man\" who makes $240,000 per year and whines about his job, life, family, x-spouse, and his father with health problems. IF your IDEA of comedy is seeing a rich dysfunctional family, or seeing Nick Cage getting hit by food, or kids molested, you might need to see a therapist. The writer and director of this movie should seek help right away if they feel this is funny... Drama you say? Well doesn't fit that category either because nothing dramatic happens. I waited and watched until the credits rolled and it left me with the feeling of \"what the heck was it supposed to be about??\". We see him go to the park and you say damn I know this psycho going to snap and start shooting people full of arrows, don't hold your breath. I have never sat through a more boring, clumsy, self-destructive movie as this and I pray to God I never have to again. I gave it a 2 out of 10. \n",

      " This is a good movie,just a good movie.Not even close to being great or very good.Why?That's because the script doesn't offer much.And most of the film's energy is provided by the always great Nicholas Cage with a handful of good supporting cast.The screenplay tends to get predictable at times and too conventional.The addition of unnecessary voice over narration at various situations is terrible way of telling a story like this.But Director Verbinski of Pirates of Caribbean fame handles the film with good focus on characters.Even when the characters are weak and hardly helps the story move along.Dave Spritz is a weather man who is going through mid-life crisis.He is divorced and is trying desperately to improve his relationship with his wife,and kids whom he sees every week.But he doesn't understand how to do it.He messes calm situations up and everything goes out of control.He doesn't know how to handle his or fix his life.And his father,a successful and well respected writer,tries to give a hand.David wants to be like his father.Successful and caring person.But the more he tries to make things work,he stumbles into jeopardy,and doesn't understand why people throw fast food at him.The film's weakness lies in its imperfect screenplay.The dialogues were smart,but its screen story lacks originality.It sometimes feels like a sequel to Adaptation,watching Cage play the same kind of role in the same way.The film pretty much goes in circles,not knowing how to develop or how to take the story to next level.It just dangles on an unbalanced thread.The characters are shallow,save for Cage's.There are some really humorous scenes and well written scenes.This is a really very entertaining film.It may be Dark Comedy,but there are signs of brightness.Cage's screen presence as a miserable man who can't fix the simplest things in life draws some resemblance to the Charlie Kaufman character he played in Adaptation.But still he holds a few surprises. Caine on the other hand is adequate as his father.While Davis is fine but underused.The other actors do just fine.Director Verbinski tries hard to pull the film out of the conventional and predictable,he succeeds but only in parts.This could've been a great film,but I doubt it.The story is strong enough.It should've been a character study than a existential comedy.But still there are some mild rays of sunshine in this shallow but entertaining Dramedy.And it is worth a watch maybe. \n",

This is just a slice of life movie. Nothing really happens. None of the characters are particularly likable. None of them do anything that is particularly interesting. Will Cage's daughter learn to love archery? Will Cage ever have a meaningful dialog with his father? Will Cage reconcile with his ex? Nobody cares.

      " I remembered seeing a trailer for The Weather Man last spring. It looked like standard Nick Cage fare, but also looked like it was basically ripping off one of his lesser films, The Family Man. The film basically fell off the map, and showed back up at the end of October. I never found out why, but I can only guess it had something to do with Paramount trying to get Cage an Oscar nom. But I really wish they went back and tinkered with the final product, because it's an absolute mess.The film chronicles a piece of David Spritz's (Cage) life. He's a weatherman, without a degree in meteorology, and is just trying to cope with all of life's decisions. He is divorced from his wife (Hope Davis). His kids hate him. His father (Michael Caine) overshadows him in every sense of the word. And to top it off, people bug him about the weather all over the street, and find time to throw fast food at him (which, if you've seen the trailer, you've noticed exactly what's being thrown). Of course, he begins to slowly see the bigger picture, and the rest of the movie just goes on from there.In a sense, the film is basically The Family Man, but much more adult orientated and lacking the whole \"what if?\" scenario. There are countless swear words uttered (many uses of the f-word are completely unneeded), and many adult style conversations and incidents going on throughout. It looks as if they took that script, and just tinkered and changed things around so that Cage could pull that role off again. He was alright in that movie, and he's alright in this movie. Yes, his narration adds a whole lot to the film, but his acting is nothing too amazing. He has had many better days (the flawed Lord of War is a recent example), and both he and the audience know it. Davis and Caine (with a horrendous American accent) try their best with what their given, which of course, is not nearly enough for them to use. The rest of the cast is off and on, with almost no standouts to speak of whatsoever.The movie's problem is in it's pacing and storyline. It does not understand what it wants to tell the audience and therefore, ends up skipping around in circles until the finale. Subplots come and go worthlessly, and allows the core story to fall behind into an abyss of filth. It has a few clever moments, and has many moments where you really feel for Cage or anyone else on screen. Only thing is, the audience is left to decipher many of the heartfelt moments, and the film just continues on into something else that is totally useless. It's totally superficial, and an absolute convoluted mess. The runtime is just under 100 minutes, but it's so bogged down that it feels like so much more. Because of the mess of the story, the rest of the film took a beating to. The visual style and editing leaves a lot to be desired (although better than the rest of the film), and only continues the lack of explanation and lack of direction. If someone took a nice polish to the script, and maybe transfixed on a tangible direction for the film, it would have been a whole lot better.Gore Verbinski had quite a bit of luck with his last few films, and this one just fails to hit the mark. Yes, it has a few enjoyable moments, but on the whole, it just does not totally work. Cage has had many better roles, the entirety supporting cast is left in the dust to fend for themselves, and the script just does not feel like it's all there. Maybe a few pages went missing before they went to shoot? Could be a possible explanation.The film just ends up feeling rushed and weak. Some may get enjoyment out of parts of it, while others may just not like it at all. It's definitely a weak film, but shows points where it could have made something of itself.5.5/10. \n",

      " The best that can be said of The Weather Man is that it is unconventional, but this alone is not enough to save what is ultimately a rather aimless portrait of upper middle class American life. Dark comedies must be either funnier or more subversive than this to be memorable.Its bland message - be the best you can be - is an underwhelming conclusion to what, at times, promised to be a savage black comedy, a satire, or at least a parody of suburban living.Nicolas Cage is arresting as the titular weather man, disillusioned with the jolly facade he has adopted for his well-paid job. The public, if they don't hate him enough to bombard him with fast food, see him only as someone who can tell them what the coldest day of the week will be - a perception all the more demeaning because his predictions are just a guess.The exploration of his relationship with his dysfunctional family is gently perceptive, but it leads nowhere exciting. His troubled relationship with his father, a successful author played by Michael Caine, should have been the poignant hub of this film. It is, mercifully, not overly sentimental, but nor is it particularly engaging. Ho hum. \n",

      " Once again Nicolas Cage (who plays 'David Spritz') shows he's not just a Hollywood movie star, but that at heart he is an actor. In this he plays a morose weatherman who is concerned about everything in his life - but it is all just beyond his reach. Cage's ability to persuade you that his character is detached is palpable. Without Cage this would be a massive flop. ( ... and it could still be missed b/c of the bad advertising campaign which made it look like a comedy.)David Spritz doesn't know whats wrong ... or what's right, but he does know it is all messed up. Even his last name is \"messed up\" having self-mutilated it from his Pulitzer Prize winning father's last name, which is Spritzel (exceptionally well played by Michael Caine). David Spritz is detached dissociated and very well paid. So he floats through life as if in a foggy dream never interacting; never reacting; always just acting. (You have to see the movie to see what happens.)As for my own personal opinion of the movie - I hated it b/c of it's blatant negative look at America, but loved it b/c it was so well acted and directed. (Make-up, production, etc. tend to go unnoticed in a movie like this b/c it would take a professional to spot what contributions were made by these crews. ... Caine's makeup looks realistic.) I'll say this, it made me consider once again how much of a blessing it is to be born in this vast and great country. 10/10-ZafoidEdit: I realized that everyone else in this movie is \"dead\" on the inside. The father is detached the kids are detached the boyfriend is detached and finally, our hero (note: sarcasm) is detached... so clearly everyone in America is detached... unless they are making a salary of over 1 million dollars a year. So the American dream, according to this story, is \"Dream to become 'dead' while alive.\" It's such typical hypocrisy of the left to accuse America of being at root evil, when all along it's the purveyors of lies who are doing the evil... the rest of us are just trying to live our lives with our families in peace.-Z \n",

      " We do not run across genuine and compelling ideas that often in movies. If we do, they come to us only as the shells of ideas, emptied of vitality, emptied perhaps by what 'they' call the profit drive. Most movies condescend to us by dealing with existential issues in a very reductive, simplistic way. This movie, refreshingly, seems to mean what it says. It deals with certain existential challenges earnestly. Some ideas I found interesting: that a) \"what's meaningful is hard,\" \"easy doesn't enter into grown up life,\" b) there's something really at stake in life, and as in any comparable situation, failure is a genuine possibility. Also, the filmmakers do break with conventional plotting. Even towards the end of the film, I felt like I was still in the beginning, waiting for a small victory from our protagonist that will kick the life he dreams of into gear. How well, overall, the movie gets pulled off is for me still unclear. The acting, while good, is not great, and greatness is needed for this movie to be what it was conceived to be. The script also devolves into the obvious at times. \n",

      " Here's why you have to watch this film: Nicholas Cage and Michael Caine together on screen. The scenes with these two guys interacting are more than superb. Highlight of the movie by far.The movie itself, on the other hand, is weird. Sometimes it wants to be a comedy, sometimes it wants to be a drama, but this indecision passes to the audience and the result is questionable. The writer and the director should have first decided what they wanted to communicate and remove all this ambivalence. You cannot try to be serious and suddenly throw a Frosty on the protagonist's face.Even this way, The Weather Man manages to generate a depressing atmosphere, mainly because of Cage's talent. I wouldn't go as far as saying that it is a social critique or introspection, because I've found the script too flawed for that. \n",

      " Yeah , that's exactly what it is ! I actually went to the cinema to see this one , as there was a long time since i did that . What can i say , it was the wrong movie to go to the cinema for and i felt sorry for the money spent on the ticket and as well felt sorry for those minutes lost. I seriously don't know what was in Cage's mind when he accepted to play that role , of course he's a good actor and usually some actors make the whole movie worth it , but not this time , not this script ! The story of a man searching for success , searching for a better life ? actually i didn't even botter to follow the plot line. The real thing to follow in the cinema was the high number of couples who came there to watch the movie and ended up kissing and making out like there was no tomorrow ... That's when i realized that this movie ISN'T WORTH IT ! Everybody was enjoying the atmosphere of the cinema ... at least that ! My conclusion , DON'T even botter ! \n",

      " My love for Nicolas Cage is growing. I never cared for him until \"Adaptation\" and my love was sealed with \"Lord of War\". This film only reinforces what I now know to be true: Cage is finally coming in to his prime with no signs of slowing down.This story is of a weather man, as you might assume. But the story is less about his career and more about his teetering balancing act between sanity and despair as he watches his family fall apart. And we watch him, simultaneously trying to fight for his family back as he reveals himself to be one of the key reasons it is disintegrating.The subplots of his career, his father's illness, Camel Toe, and the counselor are all well done stories in themselves and only strengthen the main story: Weather Man's path from the brink to... (I won't say, I don't want to ruin it for you) I want to give credit to the writer for not only a great story, but excellent dialogue. Vulgarity plays a large part in this film, but it isn't done simply for shock value - it actually adds something to the film which is hard to pin down. It's part humor, part humanity and part something else.The music was good in that I only recall one song (besides the incidental), Bob Seger's \"Like a Rock\". And it serves a purpose, which I think is more than can be said about most music in most movies.Lastly, Gore Verbinski. Obviously his directing was wonderful and he opened a world to us that we've never considered before (how many movies do you know about weather men?). But what really moved me was his use of color, giving many of the scenes a blue-gray tint. This said to me, the film is cynical. Not depressing, not dark... but something to watch with a critical eye. Thank you, Gore, for this tone. \n",

      " Not for the under 30 crowd, but if you've explored the sorry trench of the sandwich generation, this film will resonate.Cage plays his character with an exquisite poignancy, as does Caine. There are moments that make you cringe, but upon reflection, you know the writers drew them from real life experience.Well cast and well acted. Divorced fathers desperately trying to remain connected to their teen-aged children despite the barriers of the custody and visitation wars will find this film particularly relevant.Nicholas Hoult shows great promise. A \"child\" actor's role played with with the awareness of someone who is moving ahead very quickly. While Cage is the glue in this film, Hoult is the one to watch. \n",

      " I went to see the Weather Man in my local cinema and loved ever minute of it. Its a story of Dave Spritz (Cage) attempting to get hold of his life. The movie is full of hilarious moments and some great dialogue. The interactions between Spritz and his father are like a car crash, you don't want to watch but can't look away. One of the aspects which clinched the film for me is Cage's inner monologue throughout most of the movie. This was brilliantly written and adds a lot of the comedy. Definitely one to see if you are a fan of dark comedy. Not one for those who like there jokes served to them on a platter (american style). No canned laughter here guys. \n",

      " This is definitely a \"love or hate\" movie, depending on your attitude going into it. I thoroughly enjoy films that go beyond the scope of a senseless crowd pleaser to portray real-life problems and moral issues. No recent film does this better than The Weatherman. Is it exciting to watch late at night when you're tired? No, but it is very beautifully done and Cage plays the part perfectly by being his usual, stoic self. Just as in Lord of War, Cage plays the character of a man completely disillusioned by a life of high salary and no strong relationships. The film is loaded with parallels to real life, both obvious and more hidden/meaningful. The more you watch it, the more you pick up on- a sign of a truly great motion picture. Just as with any song, movie, or work of art, you will get out of the film as much as you put into it. As another reviewer stated, this is about as good as Hollywood can do when trying to create a realistic and believable story of a 'family man' at the end of his rope. (Sorry for the pun.) If the only thing you enjoy is sight of Cage getting hit with chicken nuggets, then I can imagine very few movies will be worth your time or money. \n",

      " I was wading through the tides of cinematic dreck that adorn the shelves of the local video store, searching desperately for a movie aimed at intelligent adults. I was beginning to despair when I stumbled on this gem, which I had not heard of. I was attracted by the cast and by the synopsis, and I was pleasantly surprised.Nicolas Cage is starting to be associated (in my mind, anyway) with a certain character type - the worn-down, confused, weary, frazzled, man who is disappointed with himself and beaten down by life, and is on the knife edge of desperation. This is indeed his character here and it is one the best portrayals I have seen from him. Michael Caine is also outstanding as his laconic, dying father, who is barely able to conceal his disappointment with his offspring.It is a comedy, but a very, very dark one, and a biting commentary of American social values. The humor is very penetrating and some of the funny moments are almost painful in their sarcasm. I highly recommend this movie to intelligent viewers who are looking for more than mindless copulation, grisly violence, and stupendous explosions. \n",

      " I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time. This is a movie that's not a remake, sequel, based on a comic, based on a book, ripped off of something, based on a video game, or anything. This is a nice original movie that is funny, emotional, intelligent, and overall entertaining. It tells the story of a weather man is Chicago trying to deal with his \"fame\", while also trying to deal with his personal life.I like how this movie is an intelligent comedy that makes you laugh but doesn't really use gross out tactics like most teen comedies. Now, I'm 17 years old, and yes, I'm saying this type of comedy is better. It's not in your face slapstick funny. You have to understand this man's life to understand what's funny. The narration of the movie added a nice touch and made it more enjoyable to watch, because we could hear what he was thinking. I love the truth behind it all too. This man is on the edge because of the things that are happening in his life, and you can sympathize.The performances in this movie are excellent. I was never a huge Nicholas Cage fan, but with this movie I realized how much I really do like him as an actor. Michael Caine was great as Cage's father, though I couldn't really understand what kind of accent he was supposed to have, and it kind of got on my nerves. I thought Michael Caine was funny too, because he was playing an old man who doesn't really understand the new generation. He's always asking his son questions about what certain words and products are. I also liked Michael Caine in this because it was the first time I ever heard him use the f-word in a movie.This is a great movie, and I think it's ridiculous how the Oscars completely shunned it. Definitely a must see.9/10 \n",

      " I heard so many things about this movie before I watched it - things that made me nervous. It seemed like everyone I talked to didn't like this movie at all, so I was worried about tarnishing Nick Cage's image in my mind (because I love him so much). The worry was unwarranted. I thought that this movie was great! It was so real. The humor was real humor - nothing particularly clever about it. Which I think makes a big difference. It didn't seem like the writer was \"trying too hard\" and I appreciate that. The tartar sauce bit was so funny - I was almost in tears. This is typical Nicholas Cage and if you're a fan of his characters (well, character - they're pretty much all the same), you'll like this movie. That nervous kind of twitchy thing that is his trademark is so beautifully complimented by Michael Caine's seriousness. They have this conversation after Nick gets hit by a Wendy's Frosty that is easily one of the most comical dialogs that I've heard in some time. But it's more that it is a conversation that someone might actually have - if that makes sense. I watch A LOT of movies and find a good, clean comedy hard to come by outside of the Disney section. Too many writers and directors try too hard to make up these absurd scenarios that would never actually happen to characters who you don't really believe anyways. Nicholas Cage is an actor who you believe - you watch him and feel for him and you just want him to come out on top, because in so many ways, he's just like you. Only people don't throw burritos or chicken McNuggets at me.I found myself laughing through much of this movie - but don't expect a traditional comedy. It's not American Pie or There's Something About Mary, but I think that in some ways it's a lot better than those movies. For me it comes down to the fact that this movie could have happened and that even people on t.v. have seriously messed up lives. Maybe this isn't a very good review, but don't listen to what other people say about this movie. If you like Nick Cage, you'll probably dig this movie. If you don't like the little twitchy, OCD/ADD thing that he seems to do in most movies, you probably won't run out and buy the DVD. I bought it and it's one of my new favorites. Definitely worth renting :) \n",

      " I voted this movie a 9 out of 10 because of its simplicity, humor, and just a plethora of funny moments and scenarios. Nicolas Cage and his dad (I forget the actor's name - just scroll up if you want to see the cast) did a fabulous job in portraying a father/son relationship that is anything but normal. Then again, I don't know of too many father/son relationships that are normal. I felt Nicolas Cage played his character very well and I even pictured myself in his shoes on more than one occasion (in fact, there were numerous occasions) going through the same thing that he was going through. Sometimes you just feel that no matter what you do, the world is against you. Nicolas Cage was in the slumps, but with a strong character, a strong will, and a never-give-up attitude, he did an amazing job throughout the movie.I'm only done with viewing about half of it and I couldn't help myself but to post this and give my two cents. Definitely worth watching with your loved one or with the whole family (except that some of the language may be inappropriate for little kids). Other than that, I give it an A++! \n",

      " The Weather Man is about a television weather reporter named David Spritz. David is an unhappy man and has to deal with his recent divorce from his wife Noreen, trying to see his kids and help them with their problems and dealing with his ill father named Robert. Meanwhile, David has been offered a spot on another morning television show as the weather man for better pay, but this job is in another city and David has to still balance things where he is now and try to make things right for him and his kids, father and divorced wife. The Weather Man has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast (especially Nicolas Cage as David Spritz) and good original music. I was very surprised with The Weather Man. I had wanted to see it when it came to theaters and was unable to, so now I finally got to see it on DVD. The film is very original and I liked it's dark sense of humour. The film is also very unique and a good character study of Nicolas Cage's character and some of the other characters as well. I thought Nicolas Cage did a very good job in this film and his character interested me and after awhile you started to feel for his character and hope that everything turns out well for him. I liked the film's plot and I really had no idea how the film would go or end and I was pleasantly surprised by where it took me and I enjoyed the film and was compelled and entertained. The Weather Man with it's style of dark humour and just with it's different odd characters makes it a quirky and original film and I really enjoyed it for that. One of the most original and different films of last year and I really respect it for being that way. This film didn't do too well at theaters, so I hope it gets an audience on DVD because it really is a good film. \n",

      " The Weather Man is an extremely likable, well executed film that works on every level in which it's presented. Let's start with the premise. Nicolas Cage, a Chicago weather man, deals with his family, his career, and himself. This has been done before, and sounds like a basic set up. But in the 450+ movies I've seen, I haven't yet come across the unique mood and style that this film creates.Cage is great as Dave Spritz and Michael Caine may be even better. When they are on screen together, they are outstanding and real. The dialogue is very well written and seems natural, especially when used by Cage's character. The rest of the cast is right around decent, and fit in well with the story.There are those people out there that are saying this movie is boring, not funny, and terrible. I saw no evidence of any of that while watching it. I really can't see how someone would say this is boring, because if that's true, then a large portion of movies would fit that classification as well. And it's not a full blown comedy either, I'd say that it's mostly drama with just the right amount of comedy thrown in to complete the package.In the end, I was very much drawn into this film, and quite frankly, was hoping that the running time was wrong so I could experience more of this captivating movie. I can't imagine watching it and not liking it. There aren't too many movies that I am are totally satisfied with, but this is definitely one if them. It's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but The Weather Man should not be missed. Completely refreshing. 8.5/10 \n",

I'll say the same thing I said regarding Thumbsucker; I was expecting it to be a dropdead comedy based on the commercials, but I'm so glad it wasn't. The cinematography, the music (especially Iggy Pop...thank you so much for that), the script, the acting...absolutely flawless. If someone told you the basic plot of the movie without you watching the movie, it would seem droll; but you really have to watch the movie to understand how alive the story really is. The characters are beautifully crafted and carried out. Gore Verbinski is a genius, and I love Cage and I love Caine...everyone, please purchase this movie (it's life changing). \n",

      " Good comedy is difficult. Especially good black comedy, yet when that is done really well it's about as good as it gets in my opinion. So it can really be worth the effort. \"The Weather Man\" is a little too light-weight for that but it's not bad, although a little bewildering at times.First i have to comment on Nicholas Cage. He is the real chameleon of today's movie industry. He can be in comedy or heavy drama, in action and in romance. And he mixes brilliant performances (Adaptation) with awful ones (Snake Eyes) without losing rhythm. Many times though i find him just a bit too blasé and uninterested. Sort of \"another day at work\", and this is one of those. Cage just doesn't feel that interested. Michael Caine on the other hand may not be that energetic either, but his performance is an understated masterpiece here. Seldom did i laugh as much as in the short scenes with Michael Caine present.The movie in itself is rather common comedy fare. A depressed man who has divorced his wife is bored with his job and has a hard time being a good father to his kids. He gets a big job offer and now has to choose between his kids and a huge income. In short: nothing you haven't seen before. There are some hilarious moments in the film, and some of them are really quirky - more so than i expected. And while the comedy works many times when they joke about his fame as a weatherman, and when they joke about his life, it often turns sappy when they try to involve his family. While the children are both very well cast the story about the daughter just turns too much into standard Hollywood fare, the son's story is more interesting but is not given much room.All in all this is not that bad. If Cage had been more interested and the quirky and more \"adult\" humor had been more widely used this could have been good. Now it feels to shallow to get the punch a black comedy needs to work. \n",

      " This is a story about a man that has a stupid job which he mostly hates, but he has a pretty good paycheck, has a wife and two kids that live separated from him and a father who is always serious and rational and does screw up. As opposed to this guy, who just does it all the time. It is not the kind of \"laugh at stupid\" comedy, though, it is a serious film about a feeling most of us get to have at one time or another, but very few films actually focus on it.I am talking about the confusion of one's identity. Are you who you want to be? Do you know who and what you want to be? Can you get there? The solution is simple, especially when there are no other options :), but you just have to see the movie to the end to see what I mean.The role fits Nicholas Cage as a glove, I can't imagine anybody else for the role. Michael Caine is great as the almost intangible father figure. One can even recognize Gil Bellows and Michael Rispoli from different TV shows, but with limited roles.The movie can feel a bit boring at times, but it's one of those films that create a feeling and to do it right you have to take your time. I highly recommend it, mostly to intellectuals, but then again, the feeling it describes it pretty universal. \n",

This is yet another film, like the recent Elizabethtown, that tries to ride on the coattails of brilliant \"finding your place in life\" films like Lost In Translation, Life Aquatic, and Garden State. But this film fails miserably at achieving even a sliver of greatness, as did Elizabethtown. Both The Weather Man and Elizabethtown looked great in their previews, but I guess the minute and a half of preview footage was the minute and a half of entertaining moments in their respective films. This film had a few memorable moments, and that is why I give it a 3 rather than a 1, but that is as high as I can go, and that is a very generous rating... \n",

      " The trailer for THE WEATHER MAN makes the film look like a quirky/upbeat dramedy, containing the feel good combination of food throwing and hugs. Let me say, however, that the movie is not that at all. Instead, it is an off-beat saga of divorce, dying, and nauseating sexual references. And, although I am no moralist or employee of the MPAA, one plot line in THE WEATHER MAN is so rank, it makes you want to shut it off. Nonetheless, if you can get over this rankness, you will see a mildly interesting story unfold. Cage's dopey hairdo and laconic demeanor also are enjoyable to watch. Especially when he's taking a slurpee off the face. Gore Verbinski director of that rat movie, THE Mexican, and PIRATES OF THE Caribbean seems to be searching for something deeper in THE WEATHER MAN. I praise him for that. But, I must beg him to leave the desert animal stuff alone. It doesn't belong anywhere. Or maybe just not on my screen. \n",

      " A truly eccentric story of a very complicated character whom, though having a unique profession, all kinds of men may relate to at some point. Dave Spritz is a TV presenter of weather reports by profession. His hobby is archery. He is divorced from his wife but he wants her still today. His early teen kids are having all the experiences of their ages. His father, a literary genius, is having treatment for cancer. And in winter, everyone hates him for bad weather.And it's a golden chance for Nicholas Cage. He studied the character in every minute detail and reproduced them in every scene. His pleading look before his ex-wife, his verbal abuses towards her boyfriend, his false smile in front of the camera and his blank unsure face every time he sees himself in the mirror -- all are made absolutely natural and believable with Cage's mastery. Michael Caine again steals the show as a supporting role of Dave's father. The chemistry between them is quite enjoyable. Hope Davis as Dave's ex-wife though needed more life in character, especially in the flashback scenes.In this film Verbinski shows off his superb directing capabilities apart from action or horror movies. I like his style of following Cage every moment, giving him the film's utmost importance. Definitely I'd like to see more character dramas directed by him. The success of this film should fetch him such screenplays more and more. \n",

      " The Weatherman, starring Nicolas Cage is about personal growth, albeit limited  but positive personal growth nonetheless that makes a difference in the lives of all the characters in the story. Writers tend to be sensitive, or perhaps, taken on a case-by-case basis, this writer (me) tends to be rather sensitive. I've heard the criticism that a script should be analyzed carefully to see if it warrants making into a film, or whether it is better to leave it on a shelf gathering dust. Well, my road to self-awareness on a personal level and as a writer is a long and arduous one  not a complaint, simply an observation. I recognize that I'm very tempted to bash crummy movies, especially because I feel I'm not getting any recognition for my own ideas and scripts. Instead, I'm going to attempt a proactive perspective. If you liked the movie \"Accidental Tourist\", starring Geena Davis (Commander in Chief) and William Hurt (The Big Chill, Altered States), then you might like \"The Weatherman\". If you liked Nicolas Cage in \"Adaptation\", then you might like this movie. The best thing this movie does is drive the point home that many of us human beings are complete a**holes to others in our lives as we thrash and crash our way down our roads to self-awareness. Hats off to Nicolas Cage for taking on anti-hero roles. Bruce Willis has done that too on occasion, though to a more limited extent (12 Monkeys). Unfortunately, Bruce Willis made it clear in a televised interview that he's a strong supporter of U.S. troops in Iraq which is",
      " disheartening. If you're going to make statements like that, then you've got to spell out very clearly why you support having our troops over there. But I digress. The Weatherman is very slow-paced, like Accidental Tourist. It was hard to watch, sort of like seeing a teenager doing stupid things in high school and then being forced to watch the relentless teasing his classmates give him. At first you'd feel bad for the guy, right? But then when he doesn't wise up, you'd rather just not continue watching that perpetual train wreck. In my life, the formula for self-awareness has worked like this: First there were bouts with depressed feelings, and I wasn't sure why. I did some things outside of my character which confused those around me since human beings like to be able to predict a person's character and behavior and when I broke the character mold they held in their minds, they retaliated in various ways that weren't always pleasant. Then when I felt ostracized, I did a lot of introspection, even going back in my personal history to my earliest childhood memories, and I questioned why I did certain things. Imagine dissecting your personality  it's sort of like that. One day I suspected that I might actually be a real pain-in-the-a**, as much to myself as to others. If I was reading a book and some passage I came across struck a nerve, I quickly flipped to the front of the book to see exactly when it was published, as if the time frame would be some kind of clue for me as to the relevance of what I just read - to events in my own life. Then, some time later, I finally accepted myself for who I am, and started forgiving myself for each and every stupid act I'd committed  as they came up in my memory, or as others reminded me of them. Next, I began to modify my behavior, and I'm still struggling with this one, because this part isn't easy, and it only comes with sacrifice. Michael Caine, who plays Nicolas Cage's father in the movie, talks to his son about sacrifice and tells him that very often, the thing that's hardest to do, and the thing that's right to do  are one and the same. Boy do I get that. So, once I accepted myself for who I am and what I've done, I became a much happier person. Nicolas Cage's character in \"The Weatherman\" finally accepts himself, and becomes a happier person, and the people in his life become much happier too. That's what redeems this movie. It has such a good message to all of us on how to be better human beings. This, I realize just now as I've been writing these sentences, justifies the making of this movie. \n",

      " i can understand why a lot of people are upset with this movie. in the advertising of it, it appears to be a bouncy kind of feel good comedy. in reality it's probably one of the most pessimistic visions of life i've seen since \"Welcome To The Dollhouse\". based on the advertising i would not have gone to see it had it not been filmed in my native chicago. (call me simple if you will but i do enjoy seeing place i frequent up on the big screen.) nicholas cage tends to either play characters i really love in movies i really love such as leaving las vegas and adaptation or just the opposite he plays characters i don't care about in movie i don't care to see such as gone in sixty seconds, the rock, etc, etc. here he seems to be playing the spiritual cousin of his adaptation charlie kaufman persona and once again i like.much like the 12 year old girl in welcome to the dollhouse his character seems ill prepared to cope with the world and slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune that seem to befall them on a minutely basis. everything in his life is a miss. a failed marriage, messed up kids, a mediocre job that he accentuates his mediocrity. if you're looking for lighthearted comedy this is not the place to find it. although the movie can be quite funny at times, mostly through it's audacity and partially for cages ability to take endless amounts of grief and respond as most of us might do in similar situation with bitterness and miscalculated anger i won't go so far to say this is a great movie but it straddles the fence between a seven and eight out of ten \n",

      " I was looking forward to this movie only to be let down. Its just the conflicts were dragged out and should have been resolved earlier, well truthfully I'm not sure if the conflicts got resolved, because I didn't stick around see the end. Thought the movie did make me laugh here and there. The main character just was a jerk, and it got real old real quick. The movie, isn't a movie in my opinion, its Jo Smoe's typical life, and it got depressing. I got things going on that are more worth my attention and I felt that I was wasting my time in the movie and had better things to do. I almost felt that this movie was trying to create another American Beauty, and it failed to do so. Maybe I'll catch the ending sometime. \n",

      " The Weather Man opens to the cracked ice of Lake Michigan rising and falling with the current. And, in a way, this relates to the depiction of life this film develops; a cold world in which one's chances of creating an identity that is fulfilling become less great as time progresses. And, in the end, all you can do is feel good about yourself and your \"shit life\" by looking at other people who are worse off than you.Plot: The story is centers around David Spritz, a divorced Chicago Weatherman, and his relationship with his father, ex-wife, and children. David realizes his life is not what he hoped it would be. He's messed up too much and now he wants to \"knuckle down\" and make things work, but it things might be beyond repair. David wants to make a change not only for himself, but also to please his Dad, a well respected writer, who David described during one of his many voice over moments, as an \"excellent father.\" His father is diagnosed with Cancer during the film and only has a few months to live. Now he wants to show him he is capable of making the hard decisions of grown up life and sacrificing for the sake of his family. The story is upsetting, because we are presented with a man who genuinely loves his children and wants to spend time with them, but often has a difficult time connecting with them.Critique: At first, I thought this movie was bleak. There are some very funny scenes, but overall, it ended and I felt cheated. I wanted more resolved. I wanted the triumph of Lester Burnam in American Beauty when he decides to change his life -- and this comes with pot smoking and a new sports car. This doesn't happen in this film. While Spritz does, indeed, change, it wasn't the same kind of 180 degree change that I wanted to see.I have, however, reached a satisfactory interpretation of the film. Spritz's unhappiness, in large part, is not a result of is high paying job that requires little effort -- in his opinion -- but his own inability to do something meaningful in the eyes of his father -- who isn't especially encouraging, supportive or interested in his occupation. It's refreshing then, when Spritz's own son reveals his interest in becoming a cameraman for Monday night football, Spritz is highly supportive. But nothing is ever emphasized much by the filmmaker. I never got the sense that the story or the filmmaker was highlighting one aspect of Spritz's relationships or problems. As a result, the film maintains its bleakness and the pessimistic ideal that sometimes even if your intentions are noble and sincere, there is nothing to grab hold of in this world and one ought to just be happy he isn't homeless  or something like that; deduce pleasure in the idea that you are less miserable than some people.So much for the American ideal that anything is possible and that any moment we can alter our position and attitudes. So much for the idea we ought not measure our success by the failures of others, but continue \"to serve, to strive and not to yield.\" And while it's important to be thankful for what we have, I feel like I would fall down a pretty slippery slope if I began to measure my happiness in relative terms.The Weatherman is funny at times, I guess because it is somewhat real. It shows, at times, the comedy behind failed struggles to impress and find our identity and a meaningful occupation to fill our days with. I guess \"real\" can be bleak. And when dealing with real life, not everything is resolved. One can't have everything. People fall out of love, and money cannot always fix the past. People say and do stupid things. People are insensitive, nonsensical and enjoy seeing milkshakes thrown at other people. As Michael Caine's character said, parents can never feel completely comfortable -- they will always worry about the well being of their children. This is life.And while this might be real, I guess I prefer ideal. I prefer to hold fast to the notion that anything is possible and that one ought never settle.JeromeFreeman.com \n",

      " I tried to use your corrections page but it would not allow my correction!!! Michael Caine plays the father of Nicholas Cage but has a DIFFERENT LAST NAME because Nicholas Cage changed HIS name to \"Spritz\" because it was better for a weatherman. I believe the father's last name was \"SpritzLER\" or something similar. YOU NEED TO CORRECT YOUR LISTING OF THE CHARACTERS!!! I tried, but was thwarted by your website. Now I'll find out if you really read these boxes!! :) And now I have to add some more lines of text just to get this to be long enough for me to submit it for your review....this is really not fun but I am trying to be helpful!!! Hope someone responds to this. Barbara P. aka babsbnz@aol.com \n",
